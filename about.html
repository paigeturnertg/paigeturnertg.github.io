          <p>
            I'm <strong>Paige Turner</strong>, and yes, the pun is absolutely <em>terrible</em>, but I simply couldn't help myself. I write illustrated transgender fiction. I've been reading TG stories since the early 2000s—from deep-cut archives like alt.sex.stories to Nifty and Sapphire to Fictionmania and TGStorytime. I’ve been around long enough to see every trope, every tradition, and every cliché this genre has to offer. After decades of watching the same patterns play out, I finally decided to start creating the exact kind of fiction I was always <em>desperate</em> to find more of.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a total weakness for a <em>slow build</em>. There’s nothing better than a protagonist making perfectly reasonable, logical decisions that slowly snowball into something irreversible. Where they’re practically helping build their own snare without realizing it until the door clicks shut. That "oh no" moment of realization that there's no going back. That’s the spark that keeps me writing. If I'm doing it right, I won't just describe the change; <em>you will feel it.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ll admit it: I love a good trope (they’re tropes for a reason!), but I’m always looking for a new way to deconstruct them. My longer novels really lean into the "edge," digging into power dynamics, manipulation, and the heavy mental toll of involuntary change. My shorter pieces are more like playful experiments where the fun is just watching someone walk right into a carefully laid trap.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still learning, still experimenting, and honestly? Having the time of my life. Not every story will be perfect, but I’m <em>obsessed</em> with getting better with every single one. I’d truly love to hear what you think—the good, the bad, and the "how could you do that to them?" feedback is always welcome!
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-xl">What Makes My Heart Race</h3>

          <p>
            I want transformation to feel like a <em>consequence</em> rather than just a wish. I’m fascinated by how we rationalize our way into corners we can’t escape, and that delicious, tricky gap between internal resistance and external compliance. The tension between the feminizing outer and resistant inner? That's the sweet spot.
          </p>

          <p>
            The changes in my work aren't usually some sudden magical poof—they’re gradual, messy, and driven by the kind of social or economic pressures that feel all too real. My protagonists aren't always grateful for their new lives; they’re survivors trying to keep their heads up while their agency erodes, one "logical" choice at a time.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-xl">Support</h3>

          <p>
            I’m honestly so touched when readers want to support my work, but I write purely for the love of the game. If you’ve got a few extra dollars and want to be a hero, I’d be so honored if you’d send them to the <a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/">Transgender Law Center</a> instead. They’re doing the real-world work of fighting for rights and protections while I’m over here writing my little stories.
          </p>

          <h3 class="mt-xl">Let's Geek Out!</h3>

          <p>
            Seriously, don't be a stranger! Whether you want to dissect a plot point, share a story you loved, or just say hello, you can find me on Discord or drop me an email. I could talk about this genre for <em>hours</em>, and I’d love to do it with you.
