      <p>
        Hello, lovely readers! I'm thrilled to finally have a proper home on the web. The old setup was a nice enough template, but it didn't feel quite like <em>me</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This new look is what you get when Paige has a little too much time on her hands over the holidays and a subscription to Claude Code. I have no idea what I'm doing, really, so I am certain there will be bugs. Please bear with me and feel free to reach out if anything looks wonky!
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to have this site be your one-stop destination for all my writing. I'll still post on Fictionmania and TGStorytime, but I wanted one central place I was fully in control of. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So here's what we've got so far:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Library</strong> — Browse my complete collection of stories, from short tales to full novels. Each work has its own page where you can read online or download an author's edition PDF (if I've gotten around to putting one together).</li>
        <li><strong>Author's Journal</strong> — Where you are now! I'll post updates about new releases, works in progress, and occasional musings about the craft of transformation fiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Say Hello</strong> — Ways to reach out, including my Discord server where readers can chat, share recommendations, and discuss stories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Coming Next</h2>

      <p>
        I'm currently working on adding all my existing stories to the library, complete with proper chapter navigation and those lovely PDF downloads many of you have requested. I'll also be posting some brand new content that I've been working on behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stay tuned, and thank you for being here. Whether you've been reading my work for a while or just stumbled across this site today, I'm grateful to have you along for the journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        xoxo, Paige
