      <p>
        Do you like what I've done with the place? The old site was built on a template that was... fine, but it never really felt like <em>me.</em> You know how it is when something's just a little too someone else's vision? 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This new look is what you get when Paige has a little too much time on her hands over the holidays and a subscription to Claude Code. I've taught myself just enough to be dangerous. There will absolutely be bugs—I make no promises of technical mastery—but honestly? That's half the fun. If something breaks, <a href="../index.html#connect">tell me</a>. I promise I'll only be slightly mortified.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What I've Built for You</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Fiction Library</strong> holds everything I've written, properly organized for once. Each story has its own page where you can read online or download a PDF or EPUB (when I've finished being precious about formatting). I'll still post on Fictionmania and TGStorytime, but I wanted one central place I had full ownership of. I have to say, it feels <em>good</em> to be in complete control. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Author's Journal</strong>—you're here now—is where I'll drop updates about new releases, whatever I'm currently obsessed with writing, and occasional thoughts about transformation fiction craft that no one asked for.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Get in Touch</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. Discord, email, all the ways to reach me when you want to discuss a story or tell me I'm terrible for what I did to a character. (I know. I know what I did.)
      </p>
      
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      
      <p>
        I'm still migrating stories over, getting those PDFs just right, and working on some new pieces I've been keeping under wraps. The site will keep evolving—think of this as the soft launch before I really lean into what I want this place to become.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether you've been reading my work for a while or you just stumbled in today wondering what fresh hell you've discovered, I'm <em>delighted</em> you're here. Stick around. Things are about to get interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        xoxo, Paige
