            A seasoned political operative’s career managing an arrogant governor’s scandals reaches a breaking point when a heated confrontation pushes him past his limits. When his boss’s crude power play forces him into an impossible choice, he makes a shocking decision that will either destroy his career or become the ultimate act of defiance—not knowing that this single moment of stubborn pride will set in motion a chain of events that will transform everything he thought he knew about power, loyalty, and himself.          </p>

            Kyle and Cole visit a mysterious costume shop on Halloween, and nothing is ever the same again.

The hex never quite lets you go, and the year isn't over yet.

      === HOW TO ADD A NEW STORY ===

      1. Copy the work-card template below
      2. Update the href to point to your story's index page
      3. Update the image src
         - For 2:3 ratio covers: use work-card__image (no additional class)
         - For square covers: add work-card__image--letterbox class for dark teal letterboxing
      4. Change the tag (Novel, Short Story, Series, etc.)
      5. Update title, hashtags, and excerpt

      Example with 2:3 cover:
      <a href="works/your-story/index.html" class="work-card">
        <div class="work-card__image">
          <img src="images/works/your-story-cover.jpg" alt="Your Story Title Cover" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <div class="work-card__content">
          <span class="work-card__tag">Novel</span>
          <h2 class="work-card__title">Your Story Title</h2>
          <p style="font-size: var(--text-xs); color: var(--color-rose); margin-bottom: var(--space-sm); font-weight: 500;">
