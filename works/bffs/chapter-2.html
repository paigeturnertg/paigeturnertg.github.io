        <p class="drop-cap">Gabe awoke well past noon on Sunday, face down on his own bed. For a moment, he thought it had all been a weird dream - until he rolled over and felt the twin weights on his chest. Looking down, he realized he was still wearing the dress he&#39;d worn to the wedding.</p>

        <p>Hangover pounding against his temples, he stumbled to the bathroom mirror. Gabriella stared back at him, makeup still flawless and runway-perfect despite a full night&#39;s sleep.</p>

        <p>&quot;What the hell?&quot; His accented voice was still high and musical. &quot;These things... they should be wearing off by now, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>He dialed Trace, but the call went straight to voicemail. Panic beginning to rise, he stripped out of the dress and examined his body. Everything was exactly the same as last night - the golden skin, the curves, the completely feminine appearance.</p>

        <p>Gabe struggled with the uncomfortable body briefer. The tight garment clung to his skin, and he could only work it down to his hips before stopping to catch his breath. Even half-removed, he expected to feel some relief, some return to his normal proportions.</p>

        <p>But his waist remained impossibly narrow, as if the corset was still compressing him even though the fabric had been pushed down to his hips. The hourglass silhouette in the mirror looked completely natural, like he&#39;d been born with these proportions.</p>

        <p>&quot;What has she done to me?&quot; he muttered, running his hands over the curves that should have disappeared with the shaper. This made no sense.</p>

        <p>Determined to get the restrictive garment completely off, he wrestled with the remaining fabric, finally peeling it down over his hips and stepping out of it entirely.</p>

        <p>He looked down and the world tilted.</p>

        <p>His penis was gone. His testicles were gone. Where they should have been, where they&#39;d always been, there was nothing but a small, neatly groomed triangle of dark hair above delicate feminine folds.</p>

        <p>It wasn&#39;t real-it couldn&#39;t be real. It had to be another of Isabella&#39;s prosthetics. But he knew that his brain, influenced by the cap still embedded in his wig, would insist it was real skin. His hands trembled as he reached down to confirm the impossible.</p>

        <p>The contact sent a jolt through his nervous system. His brain told him the flesh felt warm, soft, undeniably real under his fingertips. The wrongness of it all made his stomach lurch.</p>

        <p>&quot;Dios m&iacute;o,&quot; he whispered, the Spanish coming naturally in his moment of absolute terror. His legs gave out and he sank to the floor, naked and shaking, staring at his reflection in the full-length mirror. The woman looking back at him was complete in every intimate detail - he could see the soft pink tissue, the realistic feminine anatomy that had replaced everything familiar.</p>

        <p>But even worse was the realization that twenty-four hours had passed since he first entered True Reflections. And he hadn&#39;t started changing back. At all.</p>

        <p>His phone rang. Trace&#39;s name appeared on the screen.</p>

        <p>&quot;Trace, thank God,&quot; Gabe answered.</p>

        <p>&quot;Dude, Miranda is FREAKING OUT. She got texted like a million photos of us from last night and thinks I hooked up with some random hot chick. She&#39;s threatening to dump me. This is amazing! I can&#39;t wait until we tell her the truth.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Forget about that! I am still looking exactly the same as last night! Is not wearing off!&quot; Gabe said desperately, his free hand gesturing emphatically even though Trace couldn&#39;t see him. He caught himself mid-gesture, startled. When had he started talking with his hands like this?</p>

        <p>&quot;And is much worse than I thought before. She did things to me... everything is different now. Everything-&quot;</p>

        <p>He stopped himself, his face burning with embarrassment. How could he possibly explain to his best friend what he&#39;d just discovered? Some things were too personal, too mortifying to share, even with Trace.</p>

        <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Trace asked.</p>

        <p>&quot;Never mind! You come over here-NOW!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Okay, okay. You know I can&#39;t resist when a hottie invites me to her apartment.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You think this is time for making jokes?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Aw, come on! That was hilarious!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You are impossible!&quot; Gabe yelled as he hung up.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>Trace breezed into Gabe&#39;s apartment to find a beautiful Latina staring out the window, a forgotten cup of coffee cooling in her hands. Trace had thrown on a casual tank top and basketball shorts - the kind of outfit he&#39;d wear to lounge around on any weekend morning.</p>

        <p>Gabe didn&#39;t have the same luxury. He wore high-waisted dark wash jeans that hugged his feminine curves perfectly, and a black off-shoulder wrap top with flowing sleeves that showed off his golden skin and tiny waist. Layered gold necklaces completed the look, making him appear effortlessly chic. His hair fell in perfect waves, and his makeup looked like he&#39;d just left a professional salon.</p>

        <p>Trace stopped, staring. &quot;Holy shit, you&#39;re right. You still look exactly like Gabriella. But wait - why are you all dressed up?&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe&#39;s altered voice emerged with passionate intensity. &quot;Nothing of my clothes is fitting this ridiculous body! All I have to wear is this &#39;day after&#39; outfit Isabella gives me!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But you did your makeup and everything?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I do not do anything! I just wake up like this, yes?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Whoa, okay, calm down there,&quot; Trace said, backing off quickly and pouring himself a cup of coffee from Gabe&#39;s pot.</p>

        <p>&quot;Look, we did it, right? We fooled Miranda, we had a good time at the wedding. I&#39;m sure Isabella can change you back - she&#39;s a professional. We just go back, explain the situation, and boom - problem solved, okay?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Yes. Okay. I hope this too.&quot;</p>

        <p>Trace raised his coffee mug with a confident grin. &quot;Here&#39;s to getting my ugly best friend back by happy hour.&quot;</p>

        <p>Despite his anxiety, Gabe found himself reluctantly picking up his own mug. &quot;To being your ugly best friend again,&quot; he said, clinking mugs.</p>

<p>They drove back to True Reflections, Trace chatting confidently about their weekend plans while Gabe tried to ignore the stares from other drivers at red lights. If Isabella was surprised to see Gabe still transformed, she didn&#39;t show it.</p>

        <p>&quot;Ah, Gabriella. How was your magical evening?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You will change me back RIGHT NOW! You promised precisely twenty-four hours!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Hmm, that is indeed odd,&quot; Isabella said, examining him curiously. She briefly took his pulse and looked into his eyes with a small flashlight.</p>

        <p>&quot;Tell me about last night. The venue, decorations, anything that seemed unusual or different.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Nothing really,&quot; Gabe said. &quot;Just normal wedding, yes?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What about you?&quot; Isabella turned to Trace. &quot;Did you notice anything specific about the setting? What flowers were in the centerpieces?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Uh...&quot; Trace shrugged. &quot;I dunno, roses maybe? Standard wedding stuff.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella&#39;s eyes lit up dramatically. &quot;Roses! What color were they?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Um... red? Pink? I wasn&#39;t really paying attention.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Ah, that explains everything perfectly. Certain varieties of roses release compounds that can significantly extend the bio-adaptive integration period. Red and pink roses are particularly problematic.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Gabe asked, his voice trembling.</p>

        <p>&quot;It means, darling, that instead of twenty-four hours, you could be looking at... well, it&#39;s quite unpredictable. Could be a week, could be a month, possibly longer. Rose compound interference creates very unstable chemistry.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe&#39;s voice went high with disbelief. &quot;MONTHS! Never have you mentioned such a thing was possible!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;It was in the fine print. Very rare occurrence, but not unheard of when exposed to certain floral environments.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is hilarious,&quot; Trace said, barely containing his laughter. &quot;Dude, you might be stuck as a hot chick for a month! This will be the best story ever.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;NOTHING about this is funny!&quot; Gabe exploded, his voice rising passionately, his eyes wide with angry intensity.</p>

        <p>Trace grinned. &quot;It&#39;s a little funny. Relax, even if it takes a few days to wear off, you&#39;ll be fine. You&#39;re like, super hot now. That&#39;s gotta count for something.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;RELAX? You think I should relax about this...&quot; Gabe gestured dramatically at his transformed body, &quot;...this disaster? You are absolutely impossible!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I mean, you&#39;ve got to admit, the whole situation is pretty ridiculous. And I&#39;ll have something to give you shit about for years now.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella watched this exchange with growing interest. &quot;You find your friend&#39;s situation amusing, Trace?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I mean, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a tragedy. Look at him - he&#39;s gorgeous, he was getting hit on, Jake&#39;s aunt even offered him a job. It being hilarious is just a lucky bonus.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;How interesting. And you, Trace, have never experienced anything... challenging... that others might find entertaining?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Not like this. This is comedy gold. I&#39;m never going to let him live this down.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella smiled, but it wasn&#39;t a pleasant expression. &quot;You know, Trace, you have quite good bone structure yourself. Very similar to your friend&#39;s, actually.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Thanks, I guess?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I think you need to understand what your friend is going through. From a more... personal perspective.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Trace asked, suddenly wary.</p>

        <p>&quot;Well, as long as you&#39;re here, perhaps you&#39;d like to see what our treatments could do for you? Professional courtesy. No charge, of course.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;No thanks, I&#39;m good.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh, but I insist.&quot; Isabella&#39;s smile widened. &quot;You find transformation so amusing, surely you&#39;d be curious to experience it yourself?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Really, I&#39;m fine-&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella was already moving, pressing a small device against Trace&#39;s neck before he could react. &quot;Just a little something to help you empathize.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What the hell-&quot; Trace&#39;s eyes went wide, then rolled back as he slumped unconscious.</p>

        <p>&quot;What have you done to him?&quot; Gabe demanded.</p>

        <p>&quot;Your friend lacks compassion. But more importantly - what good is a male best friend to a woman like Gabriella? She needs a girlfriend who can truly relate.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But you cannot just do these things to people!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Cannot what? Give him the same treatment I gave you? I think it&#39;s only fair. Though perhaps with a few... modifications.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella began working on the unconscious Trace using the same methodical techniques she&#39;d used on Gabe, but this time her choices were very different. Where Gabe had become an elegant, sophisticated woman, Trace was being transformed into something else entirely.</p>

        <p>The bio-adhesive paste gave him a golden California tan. The hair removal was followed by more extreme cosmetic procedures, injecting much larger amounts of filler into his face. His features became dramatically more feminine - not the subtle elegance Gabe had received, but obvious, over-the-top beauty that screamed artificial enhancement. Lip injections gave him a perpetual pout, cheek fillers created dramatic hollows, and his brow was unnaturally smooth and expressionless from botox.</p>

        <p>&quot;What is it that you are doing to him? You did not do such... big things to me,&quot; Gabe asked, unable to look away.</p>

        <p>&quot;Your friend requires a more... comprehensive... education.&quot;</p>

        <p>The breast forms she attached to Trace were significantly larger - a generous D-cup. When Isabella brought out the same corset device she&#39;d used on Gabe, her smile turned predatory. She adjusted the settings far beyond what she&#39;d used the prior day.</p>

        <p>The device constricted severely, giving Trace an almost impossibly narrow waist that, combined with the oversized hip padding, resulted in an exaggerated hourglass figure that looked like a cartoonish exaggeration of femininity.</p>

        <p>When Isabella finally peeled the shaping device from the unconscious Trace, Gabe gasped in horror as he realized that Trace now possessed the same completely feminine anatomy he&#39;d discovered on himself that morning. But where Gabe had found delicate, naturally groomed femininity, Trace&#39;s new anatomy was perfectly waxed and sculpted to perfection - bold and bare in a way that screamed high-maintenance salon visits and left nothing to the imagination.</p>

        <p>&quot;He is going to kill you when he wakes up, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh, I think SHE will have other concerns.&quot;</p>

        <p>An hour later, Trace awoke to find himself inhabiting the body of a stunning blonde bombshell - tall, curvaceous, with the kind of dramatically enhanced features that belonged on magazine covers. But unlike Gabe&#39;s elegant sophistication, everything about Trace screamed California party girl.</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh my God, what the hell did you do to me!&quot; The voice that came out was breathy, feminine, with a valley girl accent that made Trace sound like a stereotypical airhead. &quot;Why do I sound like this?&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella held up a mirror in front of Trace. &quot;Meet Traci. I thought the name suited your new personality.&quot;</p>

        <p>Trace stared at the mirror in horror. The reflection showed a woman who was undeniably beautiful but in a very different way from Gabe - more overtly sexual, with a shocking mane of platinum blonde curls, dramatically enhanced curves, and pouty lips that seemed designed for trouble.</p>

        <p>&quot;Like, change me back! Right now.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m afraid the timeline is just as uncertain for you as it is for your friend. You were both exposed to the same rose compounds at the wedding. Could be days, could be months, you never know.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What does that even mean?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;It means, darling Traci, that you and Gabriella get to stay what you&#39;ve always been. Best friends-only best GIRL friends for however long this lasts!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You totally can&#39;t do this!&quot; Trace&#39;s new voice cracked.</p>

        <p>&quot;I can, and I have. Consider it a learning experience in empathy.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella retrieved a large duffel bag from behind her desk. &quot;Your new starter wardrobe, Traci. I selected items appropriate for someone of your... particular aesthetic.&quot;</p>

        <p>Trace opened the bag and immediately recoiled. Inside were clothes that made Gabe&#39;s elegant outfits look practically conservative - crop tops, micro-mini skirts, barely-there dresses, and platform heels that could double as weapons.</p>

        <p>&quot;I am literally NOT wearing this trashy stuff!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You&#39;ll wear what&#39;s appropriate for your new image. Unless you&#39;d prefer to leave here completely naked.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Why are you, like, doing this to us?&quot; Trace demanded, his valley girl accent making the question sound almost childish.</p>

        <p>&quot;Your friend needed to learn to assert herself. And you needed to learn humility. Sometimes justice requires a firm hand.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But this is super extreme!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;So was laughing at your friend&#39;s distress for three straight hours.&quot;</p>

        <p>Defeated, Trace took his new clothes to the changing room, emerging looking like he was ready for a nightclub photo shoot. The hot pink crop top barely contained his enhanced chest, the white mini-skirt left nothing to the imagination, and the platform heels forced him to walk with an exaggerated hip-swaying strut.</p>

        <p>&quot;I look like a literal walking stereotype,&quot; Trace complained, tugging futilely at his too-short skirt.</p>

        <p>&quot;You look exactly like what you are,&quot; Isabella said without sympathy. &quot;A shallow person who finds others&#39; suffering entertaining.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Ay chica,&quot; Gabe said, staring at his transformed best friend with a hint of vindication, &quot;you look like you stepped out of... music video, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Whatever! Thanks for nothing, this is totally all your fault!&quot; Trace whined.</p>

        <p>&quot;MY fault?&quot; Gabe shot back with passionate fire, pointing accusingly at Trace. &quot;You are the one who thought my panic attack was most magnificent fun!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;That&#39;s, like, totally different!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;How is this different, exactly?&quot; Gabe demanded.</p>

        <p>&quot;Because... because...&quot; Trace struggled, his breathy voice making him sound vapid. &quot;I look like a total bimbo and you look all sophisticated and whatever!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Sophisticated? I look like I should be starring in telenovelas!&quot; Gabe shot back with dramatic flair. &quot;We are both trapped in these impossible stereotypes, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But like, this is so totally not funny anymore!&quot; Trace complained.</p>

        <p>&quot;No, it really is not,&quot; Gabe agreed.</p>

        <p>&quot;How long do we have to stay like this?&quot; Trace asked desperately, turning back to Isabella.</p>

        <p>&quot;As I explained, it&#39;s impossible to predict. The rose compound interference creates very unstable bio-chemistry. Could resolve tomorrow, could take longer.&quot;</p>

        <p>Just then, Trace&#39;s phone started ringing. Both transformed friends could see Miranda&#39;s name lighting up the screen.</p>

        <p>&quot;Don&#39;t ans-&quot; Gabe began, but Trace had already put the call on speaker without thinking.</p>

        <p>&quot;Miranda! Thank G-&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Who is this?&quot; Miranda interrupted, voice was sharp with suspicion. &quot;Where&#39;s Trace?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is... uh...&quot; Trace looked around desperately, his enhanced lips forming a perfect &#39;O&#39; of confusion.</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh my GOD,&quot; Miranda&#39;s voice went ice cold. &quot;You&#39;re the slut he hooked up with at the wedding, aren&#39;t you? I KNEW it! He ditched his pathetic loser friend for some bimbo!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Miranda, like, wait! I can totally explain-&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Don&#39;t you dare try to explain anything to me, you home-wrecking whore! And tell that cheating bastard Trace that we are SO done. DONE!&quot;</p>

        <p>The line went dead with a violent click.</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh. My. God,&quot; Trace said in stunned disbelief. &quot;She totally thinks I&#39;m the girl I hooked up with.&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella laughed, pointing at his new breasts. &quot;Well, there is whole lot of &#39;girl&#39; hooked up to Trace right now! So she&#39;s not entirely wrong.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe let out a melodic laugh.</p>

        <p>&quot;This so isn&#39;t funny at all!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Is a little bit funny,&quot; Gabe said, unable to resist a sharp smile. &quot;Karma is a&hellip; what is word&hellip; bitch, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh my God, you&#39;re totally enjoying this!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Maybe&hellip; a little bit, yes.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Like, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re being so mean to me right now! I just got dumped!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;And I cannot believe you still make this about you when we both-&quot; Gabe stopped mid-sentence and sighed. &quot;Enough of this bickering. We are arguing like... like catty teenagers, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>Taking a breath, Gabe refocused on the pair&#39;s bigger problems. &quot;Isabella, we have&hellip; practical problems. What about work? I cannot show up at my job looking like completely different person.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You&#39;ll have to temporarily find new jobs. Traci said earlier that you received a job offer last night.&quot;</p>

        <p>Trace looked up suddenly at the sound of his new name, his attention snapping away from the bracelet he&#39;d been playing with on his wrist. &quot;Wait, what? Like, what are we talking about?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;The job offer,&quot; Gabe said with exasperation. &quot;From the aunt of Jake&#39;s at the wedding. Were you seriously just staring at your jewelry?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But it&#39;s so sparkly!&quot; Trace said defensively, then seemed to catch himself. &quot;I mean... whatever. Yes, she totally loved you.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;The aunt, she wants that I work at her boutique with the fashion.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Fashion!&quot; Isabella exclaimed. &quot;Perfect for someone with your new... attributes. I can help you with documentation. New identities can be arranged and delivered within a few days.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What kind of&hellip; identity?&quot; Gabe asked suspiciously.</p>

        <p>&quot;We&#39;ll come up with something appropriate.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Do I get to do fashion too?&quot; Trace asked.</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh no, darling. I&#39;m thinking cosmetology would be more... fitting for your aesthetic.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is totally unfair! His life is all classy and sophisticated, and mine is, like, super basic!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Actions have consequences, my dear. Your friend was an unwilling victim of circumstances. You were an eager participant in his humiliation.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But I was literally just having fun!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Well you&#39;re in luck. I&#39;m sure Traci is going to be all about having fun.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Believe this,&quot; Gabe said, his tone sharper than before. &quot;Maybe next time you think before you laugh at someone&#39;s problems, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Like, when did you get so mean?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;When my best friend spend three hours treating my panic attack like big joke. Funny how this now changes everything, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella dismissively guided them toward the front door. &quot;Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have other appointments. Your documentation will be delivered within a few days.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Trace called out. &quot;How do we contact you if we need help?&quot;</p>

        <p>Isabella paused at the doorway, her smile enigmatic. &quot;Oh, I very much doubt you&#39;ll need to contact me. You&#39;ll figure things out.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But what if-&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You&#39;re resourceful. You&#39;ll adapt.&quot; Her eyes glittered with amusement. &quot;Besides, isn&#39;t this what friendship is about? Supporting each other through difficult times?&quot;</p>

        <p>With that, she closed and locked the door, leaving two transformed friends on the sidewalk, contemplating their uncertain futures.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>Two days later, the new girlfriends sat in Gabe&#39;s apartment trying to figure out their unwanted reality. Since nothing had yet changed about their transformations, they were reluctantly accepting they might be stuck for a while.</p>

        <p>Isabella had sent them both home with starter wardrobes, and they had reluctantly started wearing the least stomach-turning items they could piece together.</p>

        <p>Today, Gabe wore a flowing navy blue wrap dress that hit just below the knee, paired with nude flats and delicate gold jewelry. The outfit was sophisticated and understated, making him look like a young professional.</p>

        <p>Trace, meanwhile, was squeezed into a tight pink tank top with rhinestone lettering that read &quot;PRINCESS&quot; and matching velour shorts that barely covered anything. Platform sandals added another four inches to his height.</p>

        <p>&quot;We must make some plan,&quot; Gabe said, pacing gracefully around the room. &quot;If this lasts weeks or months... we cannot just wait around doing nothing!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I literally can&#39;t get any decent job looking like this.&quot; Trace complained, adjusting his too-tight top for the hundredth time. No matter what he wore from his new wardrobe, he looked like he was heading to a strip club rather than a job interview.</p>

        <p>&quot;Perhaps that is precisely the point, no?&quot; Gabe said. &quot;Isabella wanted to teach you... most important lesson about judging people.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is, like, so messed up.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;We must play these parts until this wears off,&quot; gesturing between himself and Trace with both hands. &quot;What other choice do we have?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Play the part?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Act like these people Isabella makes us. Get the jobs, live the lives.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is literally so unfair. I look like a total skank.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But this is our only option! I will call Jake&#39;s boutique aunt. You must find work that... fits your new appearance.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Like, waiting tables or something?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I do not think it will be as college professor!&quot; Gabe said, gesturing at Trace&#39;s outfit with dark amusement. &quot;We take what we can get. We just need to survive... until this ends.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;How long do you think it&#39;ll really be?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I do not know. Perhaps weeks, perhaps month. But we cannot just sit here... waiting!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re, like, actually talking about this.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But we must! We need money, we need to live. And looking like this...&quot; Gabe gestured to his transformed body, &quot;we must play these roles!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;It&#39;s just so weird. Like, I&#39;m supposed to pretend to be this Traci person?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is better than being homeless, no?&quot;</p>

        <p>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. When Gabe answered, a messenger offered him two large envelopes.</p>

        <p>&quot;Delivery for Gabriella and Traci?&quot;</p>

        <p>They looked at each other with growing unease. &quot;That would be... us, yes,&quot; Gabe said, accepting the packages.</p>

        <p>Inside were complete identity portfolios - birth certificates, social security cards, college transcripts, even employment histories and credit reports.</p>

        <p>&quot;Gabriella Valentina Castillo,&quot; the former Gabe Sullivan read aloud, his accent making the name sound natural, musical. &quot;Fashion Merchandising degree from USC. Graduated summa cum laude.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;At least yours sounds classy,&quot; Trace muttered. &quot;Traci Amber Diamond? Seriously? That is a total stripper name! And I attended Hollywood Beauty Academy&hellip; for cosmetology.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe flipped through more papers, his eyes growing wide. &quot;It says I worked in fashion PR but... I quit to become full-time influencer? I am currently unemployed for six months!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Look at this employment history!&quot; Trace read with growing dismay. &quot;I worked at, like, three different salons, two nail places, and a makeup counter at some mall store called &#39;Glam Girls.&#39;&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Here is my birth certificate from Buenos Aires,&quot; Gabe said, holding up documents. &quot;My Certificate of Naturalization from when I was nineteen years old... even an expired Argentine passport.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is so embarrassing!&quot; Trace continued reading. &quot;It says I got fired from two places for &#39;excessive tardiness and inappropriate attire&#39; and got written up for &#39;unprofessional conduct with male customers.&#39;&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Mine is getting much worse!&quot; Gabe continued, sifting through papers with growing dismay. &quot;Bank statements showing I spent my entire savings on designer clothes and makeup. Credit card debt of $12,000 from shopping at places like... Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Look at this apartment lease!&quot; Trace said miserably. &quot;It&#39;s for some gross studio in Van Nuys where my rent is cheap because the place is, like, totally sketchy.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I live in tiny trendy studio in West Hollywood!&quot; Gabe countered, holding up printed screenshots with dramatic flourish. &quot;The rent... it costs almost everything I could possibly earn! And there is more! Instagram account with 15,000 followers obsessed with fashion and makeup tutorials?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh my God, I have a TikTok where I do stupid dance challenges in barely any clothes!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Gym membership at some place called &#39;Vibras Fitness,&#39;&quot; Gabe sighed. &quot;I... take Zumba classes every weekday morning and salsa lessons twice a week? Who has time for such things?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;At least you&#39;re not advertising yourself online! My dating app profile says I&#39;m looking for &#39;generous gentlemen&#39;!&quot; Trace said, then kept reading. &quot;And I drive a bright pink Volkswagen Beetle? Ugh.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;At least you own a car!&quot; Gabe said, holding up more papers with dramatic flourish. &quot;According to this... I have subscriptions to fifteen fashion magazines, a premium account on some clothing application, and I have taken Uber to every sample sale in Los Angeles for the past year!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Well, in the past year, I literally have three citations for public intoxication and one for indecent exposure for going topless at some beach party!&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe threw up his hands in disbelief. &quot;This girl, she is fashion crazy! There is even detailed shopping diary tracking my... &#39;outfit inspiration goals,&#39; whatever these things are supposed to mean!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;This is literally so unfair! At least your fake life is fashionable and trendy. Mine is just trashy!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Fashionable? I have no job with massive debt and entire online personality obsessed with things I know nothing about! How do I pretend to care about these... &#39;seasonal color palettes&#39; and &#39;capsule wardrobe curation,&#39; eh?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But, like, at least people will think you&#39;re cool and stylish. Everyone&#39;s gonna think I&#39;m just some bimbo.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;And everyone will think I am some shallow fashionista who cares only about clothes and makeup! But this is not just that, no? This is whole different life. I was not even born in America anymore - now I am from Buenos Aires. My whole heritage... she is completely different now.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe reached the bottom of his stack of documents, and found a note in elegant handwriting:</p>

        <p>&quot;Gabriella and Traci, I thought you should know - the transformations were always permanent. The rose compound story was just to give you false hope while I arranged this delicious trap for you. Enjoy your new lives! - Isabella&quot;</p>

        <p>They stared at each other in stunned silence.</p>

        <p>&quot;Permanent?&quot; Gabe whispered.</p>

        <p>&quot;Like, PERMANENT permanent?&quot; Trace asked, his voice cracking.</p>

        <p>&quot;We must go back there RIGHT NOW!&quot;</p>

        <p>The friends sprinted to the street, only to find both their cars had been towed. &quot;This cannot be happening!&quot; Gabe said, staring at the empty spaces. They called a rideshare and twenty minutes later arrived at True Reflections, determined to demand answers.</p>

        <p>Instead, they found an empty storefront with a cheerful &quot;SPACE FOR LEASE&quot; sign hanging in the window.</p>

        <p>&quot;She is completely gone!&quot; Gabe said, pressing his face against the glass. The interior was stripped bare - no furniture, no equipment, no evidence that the studio had ever existed.</p>

        <p>&quot;The whole place is totally cleaned out,&quot; Trace added, his voice small and scared. &quot;Like they were never even here.&quot;</p>

        <p>Tucked inside the mail slot, Gabe found another note from Isabella. She&#39;d known they would come back to the salon.</p>

        <p>&quot;Gabriella, you needed to learn to overcome adversity and find real confidence - I&#39;ve given you the life of someone who must rebuild from nothing while navigating a world obsessed with appearances.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Traci, you needed to learn humility and empathy - I&#39;ve given you the life of someone who struggles and depends on others&#39; kindness. You both needed to learn what it means to walk in different shoes. I hope you will see this for the gift it is. - I&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;PS - While you were making your way here, I took the liberty of having your former residences rekeyed and your vehicles repossessed. Your phones have been reported stolen and remotely wiped.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;I&#39;m afraid your former landlords won&#39;t recognize you in your current state, so attempting to return to reclaim your old possessions would be quite futile. Your new wardrobes and belongings await you at the addresses listed in your identity packets. Do try to embrace your fresh start.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabe&#39;s jaw dropped. For a long, silent moment, the two best friends stood on the sidewalk in the afternoon sun, two dramatically different women slowly realizing the full scope of their situation.</p>

        <p>&quot;This is, like, all your fault,&quot; Trace said finally.</p>

        <p>And just like that, they were bickering again.</p>

        <p>&quot;MY fault?&quot; Gabe exploded. &quot;You came up with this ridiculous plan!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But you agreed to it! You literally could have said no!&quot; Trace protested.</p>

        <p>&quot;You never would have been changed at all if you had not been laughing at me the whole time!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Well like, you could have stopped her while I was knocked out! You totally let her do all that stuff to me!&quot; Trace accused.</p>

        <p>&quot;I did not know it was going to be permanent! She said twenty-four hours!&quot; Gabe shot back.</p>

        <p>&quot;Well like, now it IS permanent! And I didn&#39;t, like, sign up to become a bimbo forever!&quot; Trace&#39;s voice whined, becoming more emotional.</p>

        <p>&quot;And I did not sign up for becoming Latina forever!&quot; Gabe declared, gesturing at his entire transformed body with sweeping arms.</p>

        <p>&quot;But like, at least people will take you seriously! I have to live my life looking like a joke!&quot; Trace&#39;s eyes started to well up. He crossed his arms and stamped his platform heel-encased foot. &quot;Miranda dumped me! And now I have to live in Van Nuys above a tanning salon and drive a stupid pink car!&quot;</p>

        <p>They glared at each other, then simultaneously caught sight of their reflections in the storefront window. Two stunning women having an argument on the street, looking like they belonged in completely different social circles - one elegant and sophisticated, the other vapid and overtly sexual.</p>

        <p>For a moment, Gabe stared at the reflection. Then, underneath Traci&#39;s ridiculous bimbo appearance, he saw something familiar. The way she gestured when frustrated. The stubborn set of her jaw, even with all the lip filler. He saw his old friend Trace, trapped behind all that artificial enhancement.</p>

        <p>&quot;We are so screwed,&quot; Trace said with a quiver, his voice small and vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Gabe&#39;s anger melted away. &quot;We are,&quot; he agreed quietly, but his tone had softened. &quot;But we will figure this out together, yes? We are still best friends, even if... even if everything else has changed.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Really?&quot; Trace looked at him hopefully through his ridiculous false lashes.</p>

        <p>&quot;Really. We have each other. This means something, no?&quot;</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>Chez Barre was elegant, sophisticated, and exactly the kind of place you&#39;d expect to find two BFFs having cocktails on a Friday evening. Gabriella Castillo and Traci Diamond had been meeting there for happy hour ever since they&#39;d rebuilt their lives.</p>

        <p>Gabriella swept through the entrance with obvious confidence, phone to her ear, finishing a call. She made her way across the dining room to where Traci had claimed their usual table. Nearby, a jazz trio played softly in the background.</p>

        <p>The elegant Latina gestured gracefully as she spoke in Spanish, her hands moving in natural rhythm with her words: &quot;S&iacute;, perfecto. Ma&ntilde;ana a las diez. Muchas gracias, se&ntilde;ora Martinez. Hasta luego.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Whoa, your Spanish is getting, like, really good!&quot; Traci said as the call ended, looking up from her drink with obvious admiration. She was two cosmopolitans down and working on her third, clearly relishing how she commanded the attention of every man in the restaurant. &quot;You totally owned that conversation.&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabriella shrugged with a slight smile, smoothing her stylish black dress as she eased into her chair. &quot;Is not so much, but... enough to maintain cover story, &iquest;s&iacute;? Clients at the boutique, they expect it. And after six months of this life...&quot; She gestured vaguely, as if to say &quot;it just happens.&quot;</p>

        <p>It had indeed been six months since their transformations. The first few months had been a nightmare-doctors who could find no evidence they&#39;d ever been anything other than women, police who looked at them like they were delusional when they tried to explain about True Reflections.</p>

        <p>No one believed that they were two men who had been transformed. And how could they, when every test, every scan, every piece of evidence said they had always been Gabriella and Traci?</p>

        <p>But gradually, as the futility became clear, they&#39;d stopped fighting their new reality and started learning to live in it.</p>

        <p>It wasn&#39;t all bad, either. Gabriella&#39;s promotion to assistant manager at &Eacute;toile Boutique had come with a lovely office and a salary that let her finally start paying down the massive debt she&#39;d inherited. Through sheer determination and long hours, she was well on her way to financial stability while building a genuine career in fashion - something she&#39;d never expected to enjoy.</p>

        <p>&quot;Any luck this week finding Isabella?&quot; Traci asked, but from her wry smile it was clear she already knew the answer.</p>

        <p>&quot;Nada. Is like she never existed, &iquest;sabes?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Yeah. Would you, like, change back if you could?&quot;</p>

        <p>Gabriella considered the question that had haunted her for months. &quot;I do not know anymore. Would you?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Ask me tomorrow,&quot; Traci grinned. &quot;Tonight I have a date with that super hot guy from the gym.&quot;</p>

        <p>Traci had embraced her new party girl lifestyle more fully than Gabriella had thought possible. Her new life had actually taught her humility and empathy - working service jobs, relying on tips, and being judged by her appearance had completely changed her perspective on how people treat each other.</p>

        <p>&quot;The personal trainer? Ay, chica, you are becoming quite the heartbreaker, &iquest;no?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Turns out this body has its advantages.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;You are impossible!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;But you love me anyway.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;S&iacute;, I do. Always.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Even though I&#39;m, like, a total bimbo now?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Especially because you are total bimbo! Someone must keep you out of trouble.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;That&#39;s literally what best friends are for, right?&quot;</p>
    
        <p>&quot;Forever, hermana.&quot;</p>

        <p>The two women smiled at each other for a quiet moment, reassured that not even the unimaginable ordeal they&#39;d endured was enough to break apart their friendship.</p>

        <p>&quot;For Isabella,&quot; Gabriella said, raising her glass for a toast. &quot;Wherever she is.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;To Isabella,&quot; Traci agreed. &quot;The best worst thing that has literally ever happened to us.&quot;</p>

        <p>They clinked glasses, two former bros who, through the strangest twist of fate, had discovered what it meant to be sisters.</p>

        <p>Outside, a woman with ageless features watched through the restaurant window, smiled with satisfaction, and disappeared into the night. Her work here was done.</p>

        <p>The best gifts, she mused with delicious irony, always came wrapped in the worst nightmares.</p>
