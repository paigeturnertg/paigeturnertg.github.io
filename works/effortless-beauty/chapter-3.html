        <p><strong>Trial Period: Day 23</strong></p>

        <p class="drop-cap">The good news: Sam had figured out how the curse that was gradually turning him into a woman worked. The bad news: he had a week left in his Results Fitness trial period and every moment of convenience-seeking cost him another piece of his identity. And his brain was hell-bent on taking the easy way out every chance it got.</p>

        <p>It was Saturday, and Sam was rapidly running out of recognizable parts. His honey-blonde hair caught morning light like spun gold, his diminutive stature caused the world to treat him as submissive and vulnerable, and his beauty-filtered face proved irresistible to the men who caused his dating apps to buzz constantly with notifications.</p>

        <p>But Sam refused to surrender what remained of his masculine identity without a fight. If shortcuts were the problem, then he'd do everything the hard way for the next seven days. No exceptions, no matter how trivial the task or how obvious the easier path.</p>

        <p>First step, he needed to gain back some of the bulk that his extreme diet and the curse had stripped from his body. It was going to require work and dedication, but the curse was already requiring these things from him. Sam figured he might as well reap the benefits. He sought out Blake, Results Fitness's most experienced male trainer, to give him a comprehensive workout plan.</p>

        <p>"Yo, this is an intensive program, bro," Blake had said earlier that week, handing him a sheet of paper printed with a detailed routine. "Real commitment required, you feel me? No half-measures, no shortcuts. Perfect form, full range of motion, gotta engage the right muscle groups. Follow this exactly as written, and you'll see dramatic results, guaranteed."</p>

        <p>Sam arrived at the gym Saturday afternoon determined to execute every exercise perfectly. He changed into his women's athletic wear—bright coral leggings with geometric patterns and a fitted tank top in electric blue that emphasized his slender frame—and pulled his blonde hair into a high ponytail, trying to ignore the appreciative glances from several male gym members.</p>

        <p>He moved through Blake's prescribed routine—bench press, squats, deadlifts, rows, overhead press, planks, and crunches—completing each exercise with single-minded intensity. Focused on maintaining control, Sam fully finished every set Blake had written down, and gave full effort throughout the grueling ninety-minute session. By the time he finished the final set of crunches, Sam was completely spent—sweaty, muscles trembling, and breathing hard. No half-measures here.</p>

        <p>Sam was heading toward the locker room when Blake looked up from where he was setting up equipment for his next client.</p>

        <p>"Yo, good workout today, bro," Blake called out. "Though I gotta say, you were cheating pretty hard on those exercises, know what I'm saying?"</p>

        <p>The cold sensation shot down Sam's spine immediately, sharp and electric.</p>

        <p>"What do you mean? I followed your plan exactly!" Sam protested. This wasn't fair—he'd put in the work!</p>

        <p>"Dude, on the bench press, you were stopping a few inches short of your chest and bouncing the bar. Pretty common mistake, but it cuts out the most important part of the range of motion, bro."</p>

        <p>As Blake spoke, Sam felt his chest grow warm, a tingling sensation that spread across his pectorals as they began to soften and swell. He watched in horror as breast tissue developed beneath his electric blue tank top, twin mounds growing larger and fuller. The sensation was a deep throbbing pressure that built steadily beneath his ribs, his chest expanding with each rhythmic pulse.</p>

        <p>As Blake wrapped up his critique, Sam became acutely aware of the substantial breasts now filling his tank top, their unsupported weight pulling at the fabric and making him painfully conscious that he wasn't wearing a sports bra underneath. His nipples, now more sensitive and prominent, pressed visibly through the thin electric blue material, creating obvious points that made him acutely aware of his exposure.</p>

        <p>"And on the squats, you were stopping right at parallel instead of going deeper. Most people do that—easier on the ankles, you feel me?"</p>

        <p>Sam's hips and glutes responded to Blake's words with a deep aching that spread through his pelvis as bone and muscle restructured themselves. His narrow hips widened substantially, creating dramatic curves that tested the elastic fabric of his coral leggings. His glutes rounded and lifted, transforming from flat and unremarkable into a pert bubble butt that would turn heads when he walked.</p>

        <p>"And those crunches, bro—you were only coming up halfway instead of getting full contraction. Takes all the effectiveness out of the core work, you know?"</p>

        <p>With a jolt, Sam's core contracted suddenly. His abdominal muscles tightened and refined, creating the kind of feminine ab definition that even personal trainers would envy. His waist narrowed dramatically, resulting in a pronounced hourglass silhouette that made his new breasts and hips appear even more pronounced.</p>

        <p>But Blake wasn't finished. "Yo, and those planks—I could tell you weren't really engaging your pelvic floor, yeah? I know you've got some core work from yoga and all that, but I'm talking about really digging deep here, man. Like, maximum activation—not just holding the position, but working those deep muscles hard, you know what I'm saying?"</p>

        <p>"Oh… oh, no. Nonononono," Sam stuttered. A deep, cramping sensation spread through his pelvis, followed by an intense pulling and contracting feeling in his crotch, as if his penis was being drawn inward and reshaped. The pressure built to an almost unbearable intensity, accompanied by a strange hollowing sensation that made him feel like he was being carved out from the inside. Sharp, electric bolts shot through his groin as tissue seemed to fold and reshape itself, creating new nerve pathways and closing off old ones.</p>

        <p>Then, as suddenly as it had started, the transformation stopped, leaving him with a flat front in his leggings and a distinct feeling of emptiness between his legs.</p>

        <p>"I need to—bathroom," he gasped, stumbling toward the locker room with growing panic as the alien sensations continued to wrack his body.</p>

        <p>"Hey, don't worry about it, dude!" Blake called after him, oblivious to his turmoil. "Everyone cheats a little when they're starting out!"</p>

        <p>Sam wasn't paying attention anymore. He hurried toward the locker room, hoping to escape before Blake could cause any other changes to his body. But as he entered the men's locker room, he caught sight of his reflection in the mirrored wall.</p>

        <p>He wasn't sure there was anything left to change.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The person staring back at him was undeniably, completely female. His body had been entirely reconstructed into feminine curves that no amount of loose clothing could hide. Full breasts strained indecently against his tank top, his waist curved dramatically inward before flaring out to womanly hips, and his legs had taken on a graceful shape that made even athletic leggings look elegant.</p>

        <p>Oddly, despite his obvious woman's body, none of the men in the locker room gave him a second glance. Sam needed to get out of there before that changed too.</p>

        <p>Opening his locker to change, Sam stared in shock at contents that definitely hadn't been there when he'd arrived. Gone were the jeans and casual top he'd worn to the gym. In their place hung a floral sundress with a fitted bodice and flowing skirt—still modest and appropriate, but clearly designed for a woman. Delicate sandals with modest heels sat below, along with a matching 36C bra and panties set in soft cotton. A small makeup bag sat on the locker shelf, complete with lipstick and powder compact.</p>

        <p>Sam stared at the sundress and feminine undergarments, his hands trembling as he realized what he was about to do. He'd never worn a dress in his life, but his transformed body left him no choice—he couldn't exactly walk home in workout gear that no longer provided adequate coverage.</p>

        <p>He pulled the tank top over his head, immediately feeling exposed, but if the men around him in the locker room noticed his naked breasts on display, they didn't show it. The bra was more complex than expected—hooks and clasps that required coordination he'd never developed—but eventually he managed to fasten it correctly. The sensation of being properly supported felt like relief after the uncomfortable jostling during his walk to the locker room.</p>

        <p>The sundress came next, the soft fabric settling around his curves in ways that were foreign to his mind but perfectly fitted to his transformed body. The bodice hugged his narrow waist while the skirt fell gracefully over his new hips.</p>

        <p>The panties were the final indignity—delicate cotton bikinis in soft pink that he pulled on underneath the dress after quickly shedding his leggings. The fit confirmed everything he'd been trying not to think about. He kept his eyes fixed on the locker in front of him, refusing to look down as he adjusted the waistband around his narrow hips. The coverage was exactly right in ways that made his stomach lurch with the finality of what had happened.</p>

        <p>The walk home was surreal. Sam moved carefully in the modest heels, adjusting to the feel of a dress swaying around his legs and the way his transformed body shifted his center of gravity. Every storefront window provided an opportunity to catch glimpses of his reflection, each one confirming that he now possessed an unmistakably female body to match his feminine face.</p>

        <p>Arriving home, Sam went to his closet to change into something—anything—that was not a dress, but the curse had other plans.</p>

        <p>His wardrobe had evolved to match his new reality. The options he'd been clinging to—the simple blouses that could almost pass as unisex, the straight-leg pants that didn't emphasize curves—had vanished entirely. In their place hung clothes that celebrated rather than hid femininity: wrap dresses that would showcase his narrow waist, fitted blouses with darts that emphasized his bustline, A-line skirts in lengths that would highlight his new proportions.</p>

        <p>Even the most conservative outfit he could locate—a simple navy shirtdress that fell just below the knee—was unmistakably designed for a feminine body, with princess seaming that created a defined waist and sleeves that emphasized graceful arms.</p>

        <p>His underwear drawer had followed suit. Delicate bras in 36C filled one section—soft wireless styles for comfort, more structured options for support, even a few with lace details that suggested someone who cared about sex appeal beneath their clothes. The panties ranged from practical cotton bikini styles to delicate lace pieces in coordinating colors.</p>

        <p>The panties. Sam's mind returned to the ultimate change foisted upon him today, one that he'd avoided confronting until now. Lifting the dress and pulling down the pink cotton panties, Sam stared at his transformed anatomy in numb shock. Where his penis had been just hours ago, he now had unmistakably female genitalia—complete and functional, as if he'd been born this way, complete with a small tuft of golden pubic hair. The sight made his knees buckle, and he quickly pulled the panties back up, unable to process what his eyes told him was true.</p>

        <p>He sank onto the edge of his bed, still wearing the sundress, trying to wrap his mind around the magnitude of the trap that was closing around him.</p>

        <p>His reverie was interrupted by his phone, which buzzed with multiple dating app notifications. Sam unlocked the device, only to discover his messages had multiplied dramatically. His dating app profile photos had updated automatically to show his new body: images of him in low-cut tops that showcased his curves, full-body pics in sexy short dresses, even what appeared to be a bikini photo that must have been taken in some alternate timeline.</p>

        <p>The photos were tasteful but unmistakably showcased his new body, explaining why his matches had suddenly exploded. Men were responding to someone they now perceived as an attractive female, with messages that assumed he wanted to be pursued, complimented, and asked out.</p>

        <p>Sam scrolled through the messages with a mixture of curiosity and dread. His attraction to men had been growing stronger since the book club meeting, and the attention was flattering in ways he didn't want to acknowledge. But acting on these feelings felt like accepting a level of feminization he wasn't ready to embrace.</p>

        <p>Most persistent among his pursuers was David, whose profile showed someone tall, well-dressed, and confident in the way that Sam found increasingly difficult to ignore.</p>

        <p>"Hey Sam," he'd written. "I saw your profile and had to reach out. You seem like someone I'd really enjoy getting to know. Would you be interested in coffee sometime? I promise I'm better company in person than over text."</p>

        <p>The message was confident without being arrogant. David followed up a few minutes later: "I know this might be forward, but I can't stop thinking about your smile. There's something really captivating about it. Coffee tomorrow?"</p>

        <p>The attention was exactly the kind of focused male interest that his transformed brain found irresistible. Before Sam could think too hard about the implications, he found himself typing back: "Coffee sounds nice. Tomorrow afternoon?"</p>

        <p>"Perfect! I know this great place downtown. 2 PM work for you? Really looking forward to meeting you."</p>

        <p>Sam confirmed the time and location, then immediately wondered what the hell he was doing. But the attraction was undeniable, and David's attention felt like exactly what his transformed body had been craving.</p>

        <p>Besides, if he didn't explore these feelings, who knew what other cosmic consequence might be waiting for him?</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p><strong>Trial Period: Day 24</strong></p>

        <p>Getting ready for a first date as a woman, Sam discovered, required navigating decisions he'd never had to make and skills he didn't really have. As he stood in front of his transformed wardrobe, Sam realized that "coffee date casual" meant something completely different for a woman. Or a cursed man who appeared to be one.</p>

        <p>From his drawers, he'd selected a wireless bra in nude that provided support without obvious lines, and matching silk bikini panties that slid against his skin. He wriggled into dark skinny jeans that hugged his new curves, the denim molding to his rounded hips and emphasizing his narrow waist. The soft blue sweater was fitted enough to show off his bustline without being obviously provocative, with narrow sleeves that made his arms look graceful.</p>

        <p>The makeup situation had required an hour of YouTube tutorials that morning. Sam's bathroom now contained a simple array of products that hadn't been there last week. He'd managed to master the basics of applying foundation to even out his complexion, mascara that made his eyes look larger, and tinted lip balm that enhanced his natural color without looking overdone.</p>

        <p>The result was what he hoped read as "attractive woman who doesn't try too hard" rather than "man who's recently discovered the cosmetics aisle."</p>

        <p>David turned out to be exactly what his profile had suggested, in all the wrong ways. He was attractive and well-dressed, but there were red flags that Sam, being completely new to dating as a woman, had failed to recognize until too late.</p>

        <p>"You're even prettier than your photos," David said the moment Sam sat down, his eyes lingering on Sam's sweater in ways that made him suddenly self-conscious. "I wasn't sure what was real—so many women use filters these days."</p>

        <p>The conversation that followed revealed exactly why any experienced woman would have spotted David's issues immediately. He dominated every topic, interrupted Sam constantly, and made assumptions about what Sam would order. "You probably want something light, right? Most girls do. Gotta watch that figure."</p>

        <p>When Sam mentioned his work in IT, David's eyebrows shot up with genuine surprise. "Really? Tech support? Huh, that's... unusual. I mean, most girls aren't really good with computer stuff, right?"</p>

        <p>The comment was casually dismissive in a way that made Sam's stomach clench. Sam found himself nodding along, unsure how to respond to such blatant assumptions about women's capabilities.</p>

        <p>"You're not like most women I meet," David continued. "Usually they just want to talk about shopping or reality TV. You actually have interesting things to say."</p>

        <figure class="blog-post__figure">
          <a href="../../images/works/effortless3b.jpg">
            <div class="hero__image-wrapper" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;">
              <img src="../../images/works/effortless3b.jpg" alt="Sam on his coffee date with David" class="hero__image" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 1.25rem;">
            </div>
          </a>
        </figure>

        <p>By the time David suggested they "continue this conversation somewhere more private," Sam was ready to run. The date had been a masterclass in why attractive men weren't necessarily worth pursuing, and he found himself making excuses about early morning meetings and family obligations.</p>

        <p>"We should definitely do this again," David said as they exited the coffee shop, completely oblivious to Sam's lack of enthusiasm. "I'll call you."</p>

        <p>Sam nodded politely and excused himself, grateful to escape but troubled by how easily he'd missed David's obvious shortcomings. The social dynamics of being pursued rather than pursuing exerted such a pull on him that it unsettled him deeply.</p>

        <p>The rest of Sunday passed in a haze of domestic tasks that Sam grudgingly completed—not because he enjoyed them, but because the curse seemed to demand constant proof of his willingness to do things the hard way. Laundry required hand-washing delicate items and careful attention to fabric care instructions. Grocery shopping meant navigating social interactions where men's attention felt both flattering and uncomfortable, requiring constant awareness of his appearance and body language.</p>

        <p>Every task reminded him that being female required different strategies for existing in public spaces, different considerations for safety and social interaction. The constant performance that his new identity demanded was exhausting.</p>

        <p>By evening, Sam collapsed onto his couch, completely spent. Six days remained until he could walk away from Results Fitness, and he couldn't wait for these transformations to reverse themselves.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p><strong>Trial Period: Day 25</strong></p>

        <p>For work Monday, Sam selected the simple navy shirtdress he'd discovered yesterday—the least feminine option remaining in his closet, though every moment wearing it left Sam feeling like he was playing princess with the niece he didn't have. His 2-inch heels clicked against his apartment floor as he gathered his things, the sound serving as an audible reminder of how much his life had changed.</p>

        <p>Sam applied his new simple makeup routine—foundation, mascara, and tinted lip balm. He was getting better at applying it, the result clean and professional without being elaborate.</p>

        <p>He pulled his honey-blonde hair into a low ponytail that kept it professional but still showed off the length and shine, securing it with a simple black elastic.</p>

        <p>At the office, Sam endured the continued erosion of his professional authority with the grim acceptance of someone watching their career slowly dissolve in real time. Colleagues still interrupted him in meetings, still looked past him when discussing technical solutions, still treated him like junior staff despite his years of experience. The combination of his feminine voice, reduced height, and obviously female appearance had fundamentally altered how people responded to his expertise.</p>

        <p>Sam had loathed his team's weekly staff meeting as a man. It was excruciating in his new form.</p>

        <p>"We need someone to coordinate the company's annual retreat," his manager Gene announced towards the end of the day's agenda. His eyes scanned the room before settling on Sam with a patronizing smile that made his stomach clench. "Lane, you'd be perfect for this. It really could use a feminine touch—all that attention to detail and people skills. Full planning responsibility—venue, catering, activities, the whole thing."</p>

        <p>Sam wanted to object to the sexist assignment, but the curse had him trapped. Refusing would mean taking the easy way out of additional work, and he couldn't afford another transformation. Plus, taking on more responsibilities might demonstrate to the otherworldly forces that he was committed to doing things the hard way.</p>

        <p>"I'll do it," Sam said, gritting his teeth. "I'd like to handle the entire planning process."</p>

        <p>Gene looked pleased with himself. "Excellent! I knew you'd be excited about this kind of work. It's really more suited to your temperament anyway. Just try to keep it within budget—I know how you types can get carried away when it comes to spending. All those pretty decorations and fancy catering options can be tempting, right?" He chuckled at his own wit.</p>

        <p>Sam fumed all the way back to his desk. He was determined to do a good job on the assignment, but it didn't take him long to realize he was entirely in over his head. He had no idea what was involved in planning a company retreat. He didn't even know what questions he needed to ask to figure out what the right questions were.</p>

        <p>The overwhelming complexity of event coordination became immediately apparent. Venues had availability conflicts, caterers required detailed headcounts and dietary restrictions, activities needed to accommodate varying fitness levels and budget constraints. After an hour of phone calls and website comparisons, Sam felt completely out of his depth. He'd volunteered for something that required expertise he simply didn't possess.</p>

        <p>Sam needed help, fast. He wasn't going to take any shortcuts, that's for sure, but just a little chat with ChatGPT would help him figure out what he needed to do to put forth maximum effort.</p>

        <p>Sam opened the AI interface and typed: "I need to plan a corporate retreat for 50 people. What are the basic elements I should consider?"</p>

        <p>The response was comprehensive and helpful, outlining venue selection criteria, catering considerations, activity planning, and timeline management. Exactly the kind of educational overview Sam had been hoping for.</p>

        <p>But then the AI continued: "Based on typical corporate retreat requirements, here's a complete planning framework with specific recommendations..."</p>

        <p>What followed was a detailed, professional-quality retreat plan that addressed every element Sam had been tasked with developing. Specific venue recommendations with contact information, complete catering packages with pricing, detailed activity schedules that balanced team building with relaxation, even contingency plans for weather issues.</p>

        <p>The plan was brilliant, more thorough and professional than anything Sam could have developed in weeks of research. It included vendor contact information, detailed timelines, budget breakdowns, and activity descriptions that would actually engage participants rather than torture them with trust falls and rope courses.</p>

        <p>Too late, Sam realized his mistake. He couldn't unsee the AI's plan, even if he hadn't meant to read it in the first place. It was a massive shortcut, an LLM-powered easy way out of the task he'd been assigned.</p>

        <p>It took a moment, but the cold sensation he'd been expecting traced down his spine like a cube of ice dropped down the back of his dress.</p>

        <p>Sam spent the rest of the day in a state of anxious dread, waiting for whatever transformation he'd just triggered to manifest. But his appearance remained unchanged, his voice the same, his body unaltered. By the time he went to bed, he'd almost talked himself into believing it had all been a false alarm.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p><strong>Trial Period: Day 26</strong></p>

        <p>Sam woke up on Tuesday and started his now-familiar morning routine—stretches, shower, smoothie—before selecting what he hoped was appropriate attire for another day of corporate IT work. But when he opened his closet, the clothing options had evolved in ways that suggested another fundamental aspect of his life had changed.</p>

        <p>Gone were the simple dresses and practical blouses that an IT professional might wear. In their place hung designer pieces that looked like they belonged in client meetings rather than server rooms. Pencil skirts in textured fabrics, silk blouses with architectural details, blazers with tailoring that spoke of serious money.</p>

        <p>Sam's days of picking the least feminine option from his closet were over, simply because there were no "least feminine" options anymore. He did the best he could, selecting a charcoal gray pencil skirt that hugged his curves and a cream-colored silk blouse with subtle pleating, paired with 3-inch heels that felt foreign after weeks of more practical footwear. His nails, he noticed, had somehow acquired a perfect French manicure overnight.</p>

        <p>"What the hell does any of this have to do with using ChatGPT?" Sam wondered. At least he had been able to discern the curse's twisted logic of his other changes. This one completely baffled him.</p>

        <p>When Sam went to do his simple makeup routine, he discovered his bathroom counter's cosmetic inventory had multiplied like rabbits. Alongside his basic foundation, mascara, and lip balm sat an array of new products: concealer palettes, multiple eyeshadow sets, eyeliner pencils, bronzer, blush, lip liner, and lipsticks in various shades. He pulled up a quick YouTube tutorial on professional makeup and managed to apply concealer under his eyes, a subtle brown eyeshadow, and a more defined lip color. The result looked barely passable but professional enough that he didn't feel the familiar chill of cosmic disapproval.</p>

        <p>He styled his long hair in loose waves that framed his face elegantly, grabbed the purse that hung beside his apartment door, and stepped out into the world.</p>

        <p>The walk to work went quickly enough, though Sam endured catcalls from what seemed like every construction worker in the metro area. He arrived at the same nondescript office building he'd been trudging to for the last three weeks. On autopilot, he passed through the front doors and across the lobby, with no one giving him a second look. He entered the elevator and, just like he did every day, exited it on the seventh floor. Without looking up from his phone, he stepped into the elegant reception area of Sterling Events.</p>

        <p>Wait. He didn't work at Sterling Events.</p>

        <p>What the heck was Sterling Events?</p>

        <p>Where were the offices of—what was it called again? His employer.</p>

        <p>Sam suddenly realized he'd never actually bothered to learn the name of the generic, faceless corporation whose checks he'd cashed for the past three years.</p>

        <p>Looking around, it appeared something very different had taken over the seventh floor, seemingly overnight. The layout was identical to his old office—same entrance, same reception area—only now it had been redesigned with upscale furniture and displays of wedding photos.</p>

        <p>Sam stood in the lobby, certain he'd taken a wrong turn or entered the wrong building. But the woman behind the reception desk looked up at him with immediate recognition.</p>

        <p>"Good morning, Sam! You're early today. The Morrison wedding consultation is at ten, and the Commonwealth Group corporate retreat meeting is at two."</p>

        <p>She was polished and attractive in ways that made Sam do a double-take. Her auburn hair was professionally styled, her makeup flawless, her outfit coordinated with accessories that suggested someone who took presentation seriously.</p>

        <p>Only when Sam looked closer did he recognize something familiar in her features—this was his company's receptionist, transformed just as thoroughly as everything else in his orbit. What was her name again? Amy something.</p>

        <p>Sam stared at her, trying to process what was happening. "I think there's been some mistake."</p>

        <p>"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry." Amy looked down at her computer. "The Morrisons are at ten thirty."</p>

        <p>She handed him a folder thick with vendor contracts and client correspondence, running through details it seemed Sam was supposed to understand but couldn't hope to keep up with.</p>

        <p>Sam took the folder and walked toward what had been his desk location, hoping to find his familiar workspace surrounded by computer equipment and help desk tickets. It was the same desk in the same location, with the same "Sam Lane" nameplate, but now it was covered with floral arrangement samples, catering menus, and vendor portfolios instead of network cables and diagnostic tools.</p>

        <p>His computer contained calendar appointments for client consultations he didn't remember scheduling. His email was filled with messages about centerpiece approvals and vendor confirmations. According to his employment records, he'd been working for Sterling Events for over two years.</p>

        <p>"Sam! Thank god you're here." A woman approached his desk with the frantic energy of someone dealing with a crisis.</p>

        <p>She sat down at the desk directly next to his with the familiarity of a longtime colleague. "The Pemberton anniversary party is this weekend and the caterer just canceled. We need to find an alternative before noon."</p>

        <p>Sam stared at her, feeling disoriented. This was the same location where his old cubicle neighbor Bob used to sit, but the nameplate now read "Madison Roberts." Madison was clearly someone he'd never met before, despite her obvious assumption that they'd been working together for years. Her workspace was organized with aesthetic attention to detail—coordinated accessories, fresh flowers, inspirational quotes in elegant frames.</p>

        <p>"I'll... look into that?" Sam managed, opening the vendor files that had apparently always existed on his desk.</p>

        <p>"Perfect! I knew I could count on you." Madison returned to her computer with the efficiency of someone who genuinely enjoyed solving problems. "Oh, and Elena had some questions for you about the Morrison wedding when she gets in."</p>

        <p>"Who?" Sam asked, though he was already dreading the answer.</p>

        <p>"Our boss? Are you feeling okay? You seem a little off."</p>

        <p>When an elegant, silver-haired woman rounded the corner and approached his desk fifteen minutes later, Sam assumed she was Elena. She carried herself with an authoritative presence, her tailored suit and perfect makeup suggesting someone who'd built a successful business through determination and vision.</p>

        <p>"Sam, what's your take on the Morrison situation?" Elena asked, settling into the chair beside his desk. "I know you've handled similar vendor emergencies before. Should we pivot to the backup caterer or try to salvage this?"</p>

        <p>Sam wasn't used to being talked to like this at work. Where his manager Gene would have dumped problems on subordinates with condescending assumptions, Elena was treating him like a professional whose opinion actually mattered.</p>

        <p>As the day progressed, Sam discovered that his new coworkers were genuinely pleasant to be around. Madison had a quick wit and handled stress with grace, laughing easily with clients and offering creative solutions to impossible problems. Elena was supportive and encouraging, treating Sam like a valued team member whose expertise she respected—a far cry from the dismissive, sexist management style he'd endured before.</p>

        <p>Sam resented how much he was starting to like them despite himself. It would have been so much easier to maintain his cynical detachment if they were insufferable, but Madison's dry humor kept catching him off guard and Elena's genuine respect for his opinions was almost impossible to dismiss. The curse wasn't just changing his body and career—it was forcing him to develop actual human connections, which felt like the cruelest transformation yet.</p>

        <p>The job, on the other hand, was exactly as tedious as Sam had feared. Client phone calls required managing emotional responses to catering changes and venue limitations. Vendor coordination involved negotiating contracts and managing delivery schedules for flowers, linens, and decorative elements he'd never cared about. Site visits required inspecting spaces and discussing setup requirements with people who took balloon arrangements seriously enough to argue about color saturation.</p>

        <p>Sam discovered he could do the work—it wasn't technically complicated—but it required constant social interaction and attention to details that felt monumentally unimportant. More critically, there was no way to slack off while doing it. Every task demanded phone calls, relationship management, and client hand-holding that made his old IT job look like a vacation by comparison.</p>

        <p>"The Hendersons want to know if we can change the centerpieces from peonies to garden roses," Madison asked during a mid-morning crisis. "But the florist says garden roses will clash with the bridesmaids' dresses."</p>

        <p>Sam found himself coordinating a four-way phone call between the bride, her florist, and a color consultant to resolve a dispute about flower selection. The conversation lasted forty-five minutes and accomplished absolutely nothing beyond confirming that event planning was a special kind of interpersonal hell designed to torment Sam particularly.</p>

        <p>The afternoon was taken up by managing vendor relationships and client expectations while Sam longed for the days when his biggest problem was users who couldn't remember their passwords. Every conversation required emotional labor he'd never had to perform, every decision carried consequences that would affect someone's "special day," and every vendor relationship demanded the kind of diplomatic finesse that made network troubleshooting seem like a relaxing pastime.</p>

        <p>By six o'clock, Sam had survived his first full day at Sterling Events without triggering any cosmic consequences, though he felt emotionally drained. As he gathered his purse and prepared to leave the office, Madison was already packing up her things while Elena reviewed tomorrow's schedule—just another ordinary day in their world, even if it felt surreal to him.</p>

        <p>Four days remained in his trial period. But as the changes spread further from his body into his entire reality—his job, his workplace, even his coworkers—Sam was beginning to doubt that everything would simply snap back when the thirty days ended. The transformations felt too complete, too thoroughly woven into the fabric of his existence. Still, it was the only hope he had left to cling to. What else could he do but fight through the remaining days and hope that Jessica had been telling the truth about walking away?</p>
