        <p class="drop-cap">There are certain establishments that appear only when they are needed, and only to those who need them most desperately. Kyle Nguyen and Cole Russo were about to enter such a place, though they could not have known this as they hurried through the October darkness toward their particular doom.</p>
<p>They had tried four other costume shops already, and each had already disappointed them-picked over, depleted, offering nothing that would serve their purpose. They needed something special. Something convincing. Halloween night was upon them, the Sigma Chi party would begin in ninety minutes, and they had nothing.</p>
<p>The boys wanted what young men have wanted since time immemorial: to be seen, to be desired, to matter to those they admired. There is no shame in such wanting. The tragedy lies in what one is willing to sacrifice to achieve it, and in failing to understand that some sacrifices, once made, cannot be unmade.</p>
<p>&quot;Last shop,&quot; Kyle said, stopping before a storefront neither could recall seeing before, though they had walked this street dozens of times. The sign read &quot;Crossroads Costumes&quot; in faded gold lettering that seemed to glow faintly in the streetlights. &quot;If they don&#39;t have anything, we&#39;ll just stay home tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Finally.&quot; Cole pulled his hoodie tighter against the chill. His frame was soft where Kyle&#39;s was angular, his face round where Kyle&#39;s was sharp. These differences would prove temporary. Soon, both would be reshaped according to templates neither had chosen. &quot;We should&#39;ve stayed home in the first place. We&#39;re not on the list, we don&#39;t know anyone there, and showing up uninvited to a frat party is objectively a terrible idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s why we need costumes,&quot; Kyle countered with the particular certainty of one who believes logic will overcome all obstacles. &quot;Something that makes us look like we belong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or we could accept that some things aren&#39;t meant to happen and spare ourselves the humiliation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes you have to actually do something instead of sitting around contemplating whether it&#39;s rational.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever. Last shop.&quot; Cole sighed with the resignation of one who knows he walks toward folly but sees no path around it.</p>
<p>Kyle believed himself practical, efficient, a solver of problems. He approached life as a series of puzzles requiring only the correct application of logic and effort. If one wanted to attend a party, one acquired the means of entry. If one wanted to speak to a girl, one created opportunities for conversation. That these approaches had not yet yielded the results he desired suggested only that he had not yet found the optimal strategy, not that the strategy itself was flawed.</p>
<p>Cole Russo was softer in both body and temperament, given to philosophical considerations that his companion found impractical. He understood, in ways Kyle did not, that wanting something did not make it achievable, that effort did not always yield rewards, that sometimes the wise course was acceptance rather than action. But he followed Kyle regardless, as he always did, because friendship meant honoring even foolish endeavors, and because some small part of him still hoped that Kyle might be right.</p>
<p>Both were clever. Both were educated. Both understood, in the abstract, that the world was not always kind to those who wanted things.</p>
<p>Neither understood how unkind it could be.</p>
<p>The shop waited for them, as it had waited for so many others. Kyle pushed open the door without hesitation, without consideration, without the caution that might have saved them had they possessed the sense to exercise it.</p>
<p>But there would be no sense that evening. Sense had departed when they set out on this errand, and it would not return before the damage was done.</p>
<p>The bell above the door chimed-a sound like celebration, or perhaps like warning, depending upon one&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>Inside, the shop smelled of old fabric and something sweeter. Two women emerged from the shadows at the back of the establishment. They were twins, or perhaps something closer than twins-two halves of a single purpose. Gray hair pulled into identical buns. Cardigans that had seen decades pass. Eyes that held knowledge the boys could not fathom.</p>
<p>Their nametags proclaimed them Zelda and Zara, as if such simple appellations could encompass what they were.</p>
<p>&quot;Cutting it close, boys,&quot; the one on the left-Zelda-spoke with warmth that might have been genuine, or might have been the warmth of a spider greeting flies. Her eyes assessed them with the precision of one who has measured countless souls and found them all wanting in infinite ways.</p>
<p>&quot;What can we do for you?&quot; asked Zara, though the sisters surely knew already. They always knew.</p>
<p>Kyle stepped forward, believing himself in control of the transaction to come. &quot;We need costumes for tonight. Something good. We&#39;re going to a party and we need to look like we belong there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sigma Chi?&quot; Zelda smiled, a small and knowing expression.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you-&quot; Kyle started.</p>
<p>&quot;Halloween night, two college boys desperate for costumes, worried about belonging somewhere.&quot; Zara moved among the racks, her fingers trailing across fabric with the familiarity of long practice. &quot;We&#39;ve been doing this a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>Longer than the boys could imagine. Longer, perhaps, than the city itself had stood.</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#39;re not on the list,&quot; Zelda observed, not as a question but as simple fact.</p>
<p>Kyle shifted uncomfortably. &quot;That&#39;s why we need good costumes. Ones that&#39;ll get us past the door. Something that will make us look like something other than&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Us,&quot; Cole supplied.</p>
<p>The sisters exchanged a glance-a moment of silent communication that should have warned the boys, had they not been in such a desperate state.</p>
<p>Kyle had been building courage to approach Jessica Miller for six weeks. She sat three rows ahead of him in Economics, actually engaged with the material instead of scrolling through her phone, asked questions that demonstrated real understanding rather than mere grade-grubbing. He had convinced himself that if he could just talk to her outside the classroom, outside the formal structure of academic hierarchy, she would see him as something more than another classmate. The Sigma Chi party represented opportunity-a casual environment where conversation might flow naturally, where he might finally demonstrate his worth.</p>
<p>Cole had his own reasons for wanting to attend, though he would have claimed them less significant than they were. Emma Laurent had eviscerated their philosophy professor&#39;s argument about qualia the previous week, and watching her dismantle the man&#39;s logic had been the single most erotic thing Cole had witnessed during his time at college. He had managed exactly two conversations with her, both about assignments, both conducted in the halting manner of someone who forgets how to form coherent sentences in the presence of beauty. Kyle had convinced him this party was his chance to speak to her like an actual human being instead of a nervous wreck who could barely string together subject and predicate.</p>
<p>The universe, or fate, or something older than either, prepared to grant their wishes. As such things often go, they would receive precisely what they asked for, and it would destroy them.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have something,&quot; Zelda announced, and both sisters smiled with identical warmth, identical welcome, identical purpose. &quot;Two costumes that would be absolutely perfect. You&#39;ll get into that party, we guarantee it.&quot;</p>
<p>A guarantee from the sisters. How many had heard such promises before? How many had accepted them, believing they understood the terms?</p>
<p>&quot;And they come with free alterations!&quot; Zara added brightly. &quot;Guaranteed to fit perfectly.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle brightened at this news, as the sisters knew he would. &quot;Well, we can&#39;t beat free.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, nothing the sisters offered was free. There was always a price, though the boys would not understand what they had paid until the bill came due.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow us,&quot; Zelda instructed, her voice kind as a grandmother&#39;s. &quot;We have dressing rooms in the back. Much more private for trying things on.&quot;</p>
<p>She led Kyle down a narrow hallway to the left, while Zara guided Cole to the right. The dressing rooms, it seemed, were at opposite ends of the shop. This too should have struck them as odd, but desperation makes poor counsel, and the boys were desperate indeed.</p>
<p>Kyle found himself in a small alcove, curtained off from the world, alone with his choices and his ignorance. No mirror graced the space-only hooks for clothing and a bench worn smooth by use. By how much use, over how many years, he did not consider.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are,&quot; Zelda said. &quot;Make yourself comfortable. I&#39;ll be right back with your costume.&quot;</p>
<p>She withdrew, leaving Kyle alone in the silence of the dressing room. Somewhere distant in the shop, he could hear Cole&#39;s voice, muffled by walls and fabric.</p>
<p>Zelda returned bearing a garment bag, which she hung with care before stepping back beyond the curtain.</p>
<p>&quot;Try this on and let me know if you need help with anything,&quot; she called through the fabric barrier, her voice honey-sweet.</p>
<p>Kyle unzipped the bag. A cheerleader&#39;s uniform spilled forth-bright red shell top with white trim, pleated skirt of alarming brevity, sports bra, white athletic short-shorts, white crew socks, white sneakers, and a platinum blonde wig crowned with a high ponytail and massive red bow.</p>
<p>His stomach dropped with the particular nausea of one who sees the path before them and knows it leads nowhere good, yet can perceive no alternative.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, this is-this is a girl&#39;s costume,&quot; he called through the curtain.</p>
<p>From the opposite end of the shop, distant but audible, came Cole&#39;s voice, tight with something that was not quite fear but perhaps fear&#39;s younger sibling: &quot;There&#39;s been some kind of mistake-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is,&quot; Zelda replied, her tone unchanged, as pleasant as if they were discussing the weather. &quot;That&#39;s the costume.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle heard Zara&#39;s voice from the far end of the shop, saying something similar to Cole. They had been given the same response, the same absence of apology, the same implication that this was exactly as it should be.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not wearing a girl&#39;s costume,&quot; Kyle protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you&#39;re not getting into that party.&quot; The words were delivered without malice, without judgment. Zelda&#39;s voice remained sympathetic, understanding even, but utterly immovable. &quot;Girls without invitations get into frat parties. Boys without invitations get turned away. That&#39;s just reality.&quot;</p>
<p>From across the shop, Kyle heard Cole arguing: &quot;We can&#39;t just-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jessica and Emma will be at that party,&quot; Zelda continued, and her voice had dropped to something softer, more intimate, the voice of one who knows precisely where to press to cause the maximum capitulation. &quot;Having a wonderful time. While you sit at home wishing you&#39;d been braver.&quot;</p>
<p>The words struck Kyle precisely where they were meant to strike-at his pride, at his desire, at the six weeks he had spent building up the courage to approach Jessica Miller, only to watch opportunity after opportunity slip past.</p>
<p>&quot;Look,&quot; Zelda said, and she was closer to the curtain now, her voice nearly conspiratorial. &quot;These aren&#39;t ordinary costumes. They&#39;re special. Halloween magic. Real magic. You&#39;ll be completely unrecognizable. You&#39;ll walk right past the door, talk to whoever you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Magic,&quot; Kyle repeated, skeptical but desperate. A dangerous combination.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s Halloween. The veil is thin. Some of us know how to work with that.&quot; A pause, perfectly timed. &quot;I guarantee you&#39;ll get closer to Jessica tonight if you wear this. But it&#39;s your choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Choice. Another word heavy with irony, for what choice did Kyle truly have? He could refuse and return home, his evening wasted, his courage gathered for nothing. Or he could accept, could trust in the promise of magic and transformation, could believe that for one night he might become someone who mattered to Jessica Miller.</p>
<p>He stood in the alcove in his jeans and t-shirt, staring at the cheerleader uniform, and felt the weight of the decision pressing upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;It won&#39;t fit,&quot; he said finally, grasping at the last rational objection remaining to him. &quot;I&#39;m too tall, too-it&#39;s not going to work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s what the free alterations are for,&quot; Zelda assured him, her voice warm with promise. &quot;We&#39;ll make sure it fits perfectly. Just try it on and we&#39;ll adjust from there.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle drew a breath, and with it drew his fate toward him. Believing himself engaged in a simple transaction, he began to undress.</p>
<p>Stripped to his boxers, he regarded the pile of feminine garments with the particular dismay of one who has committed to a course of action before fully considering its implications. The white athletic shorts went on first-uncomfortably tight, squeezing his anatomy while also revealing every private contour. The garment bore the designation &quot;shorts&quot; in only the most technical sense, possessing an inseam so minimal that when paired with the pleated skirt, he would be perpetually on the edge of indecency.</p>
<p>Then the sports bra, hanging loose and pointless on his flat chest. The shell top was stretchy polyester that clung to his torso and terminated just above his navel, leaving his midriff exposed in a manner that made him profoundly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The skirt presented greater difficulty. He stepped into it and attempted to draw it up over his hips, but the garment would not comply. The waistband caught, refused to close. His frame was too broad, his stomach too substantial for this scrap of pleated fabric designed for someone much smaller.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, this doesn&#39;t fit,&quot; Kyle called through the curtain, relief and disappointment warring in his voice. Here was his escape, the rational end to this mad venture. &quot;The skirt won&#39;t close. I told you I was too big.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me help with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Zelda pushed through the curtain with the care of one who has performed this service many times before. She circled behind him, examining the problem with a professional eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see. You just need to suck in your stomach. Here-&quot;</p>
<p>She placed her hands on his sides with a grip that was firm, almost proprietary. &quot;Big breath in. Hold it.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle obeyed, drawing air deep into his lungs and pulling his stomach inward as tightly as he could manage. It would not be enough-he could feel that even as he held his breath. The gap was too wide, the zipper too distant from its mate.</p>
<p>Zelda forced the zipper upward. Her hands were strong, decisive, allowing no resistance. The pressure was intense, the waistband digging into his sides with force that should have been painful-</p>
<p>And then something shifted.</p>
<p>The tight pressure vanished as if it had never been. The skirt suddenly fit perfectly, the zipper gliding smoothly closed with a soft sound of finality. Kyle released his breath and looked down at his exposed midriff.</p>
<p>His stomach was flat. Not merely flat but taut, defined, his bronze skin smooth over what appeared to be actual abdominal muscles. He had never possessed such musculature. He had, in fact, carefully avoided the gym for the entirety of his college career.</p>
<p>It was strange. Very strange. But perhaps it was merely the compression of the skirt, some trick of the tight waistband that created the illusion of definition. Surely that was the rational explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;There we go,&quot; Zelda said with satisfaction. &quot;Much better. Though the skirt is quite short, isn&#39;t it? You can see your underwear. And&hellip; what&#39;s inside of it. That bulge won&#39;t do at all. Let me just make sure everything is secure.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Kyle could ask what she meant by secure, she reached under his skirt and grasped the waistband of the shorts with both hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, what are you-&quot;</p>
<p>She hiked them upward with a strong, decisive motion.</p>
<p>The sensation was immediate and terrible. Everything between his legs drew inward with the upward pull, tucking up and in and simply gone. Kyle&#39;s hands flew to his crotch, pressing desperately against the shorts.</p>
<p>Smooth. Completely smooth. Where his anatomy should have been, there was only flatness, only fabric over absence.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you-&quot; His voice emerged strangled, higher than it should have been. &quot;Where did it-I can&#39;t feel-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All secure now,&quot; Zelda said with the calm of one discussing the weather. &quot;You&#39;re all set. Why don&#39;t you step out and we&#39;ll see if you need any other adjustments?&quot;</p>
<p>She withdrew through the curtain before Kyle could formulate a response, leaving him alone with his horror.</p>
<p>Kyle stood frozen, both hands pressed to his crotch, feeling through the layers of fabric for something that was no longer there. Smooth. Flat. No matter where he touched, no matter how frantically he searched, he could find nothing. It was simply gone, as if it had never existed at all.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no-&quot; He grabbed at the waistband of the skirt, trying to pull it down, trying to reverse whatever obscenity had just occurred-</p>
<p>From the opposite end of the shop, Cole&#39;s voice rang out, loud and panicked: &quot;What did you do?! It&#39;s gone! It&#39;s completely-&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle tore through the curtain without thought, without consideration for his state of dress, desperate to reach Cole, to confirm that this nightmare was shared and therefore perhaps not a delusion.</p>
<p>Cole burst into the main room from the opposite direction at precisely the same moment.</p>
<p>They stopped, staring at one another in mutual horror.</p>
<p>Cole appeared profoundly wrong. He wore a black dress with white lace trim-the bodice fitted so tightly to his torso that it had created a dramatic waist from his previously soft middle. His chest looked fuller somehow, pushed upward by the corseting into something that suggested curves where none should exist. A white apron was tied at his waist. The skirt of the dress was full but hung oddly, and he wore sheer black stockings and black patent leather heels that caused him to wobble with each small movement. His face remained round and masculine, but his body had been reshaped into something that defied his natural form.</p>
<p>And between his legs, visible in the way the skirt fell-smooth. Obviously, unnaturally smooth.</p>
<p>&quot;Dude,&quot; Kyle managed, his voice shaking. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to YOU?&quot; Cole shot back, wobbling dangerously in the heels. &quot;Your stomach-you have abs now! And you-&quot; He gestured vaguely at Kyle&#39;s lower half. &quot;You can&#39;t-I can&#39;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know!&quot; Kyle&#39;s voice cracked with panic. &quot;It&#39;s gone! I can&#39;t feel anything! What did they do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know! She laced me into this thing-&quot; Cole grabbed at his corseted waist &quot;-and it crushed everything, and then she gave me these ruffled panties and pulled them up and-and now there&#39;s nothing! It&#39;s flat! It&#39;s completely flat!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mine too!&quot; Kyle was approaching hyperventilation. &quot;She pulled up these shorts and everything just-disappeared! We need to get out of here. We need to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boys, boys.&quot;</p>
<p>Zelda and Zara emerged from their respective corridors with the synchronized timing of those who have performed this scene many times before. They appeared completely calm, utterly untroubled by the panic before them.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s no need for alarm,&quot; Zelda said, her voice maintaining its kindly warmth.</p>
<p>&quot;No need for-&quot; Cole&#39;s voice was rising toward hysteria. &quot;You did something to us! This isn&#39;t just a costume! You changed our bodies!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We told you they were special costumes,&quot; Zara replied with perfect reasonableness. &quot;Halloween magic. We were quite clear about that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You need to change us back!&quot; Kyle demanded, though his voice carried the desperation of one who already suspects the answer. &quot;Right now! Whatever you did, undo it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#39;t change you back.&quot; Zelda&#39;s voice remained kind but utterly immovable. &quot;The magic works forward, not backward. Each alteration builds on the last.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then-then we&#39;re leaving!&quot; Cole declared, turning toward the door. He managed one step before his ankle twisted in the unfamiliar heels, sending him grabbing for a costume rack to maintain his balance.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave like that?&quot; Zara gestured at them with something that might have been sympathy. &quot;Looking half-finished?&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle looked down at himself. He wore a cheerleader uniform that exposed his newly taut midriff and smooth legs, but he retained his masculine face, his hairy arms, his angular features. The blonde wig sat forgotten in the dressing room. He resembled nothing so much as a man in drag-a man in drag who had undergone some inexplicable partial transformation that defied all logic and reason.</p>
<p>Cole&#39;s situation was worse. The corseting and heels made him appear compressed and unnatural, his round masculine face sitting atop a body that had been forced into feminine shapes through what appeared to be considerable violence. He wobbled with every small shift of weight, clearly moments from falling.</p>
<p>&quot;We look ridiculous,&quot; Kyle admitted quietly, the fight draining from him as reality settled over his shoulders like a shroud.</p>
<p>&quot;You look half-complete,&quot; Zelda corrected. &quot;And if you walk out of here like that, you&#39;ll stay that way. Do you really want to return to your dormitory, to attend your classes, to live your lives looking like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Cole&#39;s voice sharpened with fresh fear. &quot;What do you mean &#39;stay that way&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The spell has already begun,&quot; Zara explained with the patience of a teacher addressing slow students. &quot;As we said, the alterations only move forward. We can finish them properly, make you look completely natural, completely convincing. You go to your party, and then the spell completes at midnight. Or you can leave now and remain stuck precisely as you are.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle and Cole looked at one another, and in each other&#39;s eyes saw the same dawning horror, the same terrible recognition that they had stumbled into something far beyond their understanding, and that the path forward was no clearer than the path back.</p>
<p>&quot;Midnight?&quot; Kyle asked, his mind still seeking some rational framework, some timeline that would restore order to chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;The magic does its work tonight,&quot; Zelda said, her tone calming and precisely measured. &quot;When Halloween is over, the transformation is over.&quot;</p>
<p>Over. The word should have sparked some warning in Kyle&#39;s mind, some recognition that &quot;over&quot; and &quot;reversed&quot; were not synonyms. But he heard only what he wished to hear-that the ordeal would end with the holiday, that midnight would bring restoration.</p>
<p>&quot;If we let you finish this,&quot; Cole said slowly, &quot;we&#39;ll look convincing enough to get into the party?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Zara confirmed. &quot;No one will have any idea who you really are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we can take off the costumes after the party?&quot; Kyle pressed, seeking the reassurance that would make this nightmare tolerable.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!&quot; Both sisters laughed, and their laughter was warm and genuine and completely without malice. &quot;You don&#39;t have to dress as a cheerleader and maid for the rest of your lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle looked at Cole. They were already changed. Their bodies were already altered in ways that defied natural law. To leave now, half-finished and obviously wrong, would be to carry this horror into their normal lives, to face their classmates and professors and families wearing the evidence of their folly.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Cole said, his jaw set with the determination of one who has chosen the least terrible of several terrible options. &quot;Finish it. But make it fast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; the sisters said in unison, their voices harmonizing in a way that should have been impossible for two separate people.</p>
<p>They led the boys to a large three-panel mirror in the center of the room. Kyle and Cole positioned themselves before it, side by side, and confronted their reflections.</p>

        <p>The image that greeted them was damning. Two young men who had clearly suffered some strange affliction, wearing costumes that fit poorly and served only to emphasize how wrong everything had become. They looked like the subjects of some bizarre experiment, like victims of a curse that had been interrupted mid-casting.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s start with the obvious problems,&quot; Zelda said, moving to stand behind Kyle. &quot;You&#39;re far too tall for that skirt. It looks obscenely short.&quot;</p>
<p>She was correct. The pleated skirt didn&#39;t even cover the shorts, ending so high on his thighs that any significant movement would render him indecent.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what I-&quot; Kyle began, but Zelda was already acting.</p>
<p>She crouched down and grasped the hem of the skirt, tugging it downward with firm purpose. The skirt remained its original length.</p>
<p>Kyle, however, did not.</p>
<p>He felt a pulling sensation through his entire body, a stretching in reverse, the floor rushing upward as his perspective shifted. In the mirror, he watched himself diminish-six inches disappearing in seconds as if they had never been. The skirt hem fell to a more reasonable length on his now-shorter thighs.</p>
<p>But his legs were transforming as well. His calves slimmed dramatically, the muscle definition changing from masculine to feminine. His thighs gained curves where there had been only straight lines. His entire leg structure was shifting, reshaping itself from gangly to toned and gracefully proportioned.</p>
<p>&quot;What-&quot; Kyle grabbed at the mirror frame for balance, staring at legs that were no longer his own. &quot;What did you just-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Much better,&quot; Zelda said, standing with the satisfaction of work well done. &quot;Not indecent anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you,&quot; Zara said, moving behind Cole with purpose. &quot;Your skirt hangs incorrectly. It should have volume, should poof outward. You need proper foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>She produced a white crinoline from a nearby rack-layers of stiff netting and tulle that rustled as she held it out. &quot;Step into this.&quot;</p>
<p>Cole looked at Kyle in the mirror, his eyes wide with fear and something approaching despair. But he stepped into the crinoline regardless, because what alternative remained to him?</p>
<p>Zara pulled the garment upward-over his calves, his knees, his thighs. Cole felt a stretching sensation, his perspective rising as he gained height. In the mirror, he watched his legs lengthen and refine, his calves curving gracefully, his thighs becoming willowy and shapely beneath the black stockings. By the time she tied the crinoline at his waist, he had gained four inches, his legs now statuesque and elegant in a manner completely foreign to his natural form.</p>
<p>The maid skirt suddenly achieved its intended effect, poofing outward over the crinoline in a flirty bell shape that emphasized his newly elongated legs and drew attention to the dramatic curve from his corseted waist to his hips.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; Zara said with evident satisfaction. &quot;Much better.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle and Cole stared at each other in the mirror. Kyle was noticeably shorter now, his lower body completely reshaped into something lean and athletic. Cole was taller, willowy, his legs elegant in a way that seemed to belong to someone else entirely.</p>
<p>Neither could quite believe what they were witnessing, yet the evidence stood before them, undeniable and terrible.</p>
<p>&quot;The tops still don&#39;t fit correctly, though,&quot; Zara noted, circling them with a critical eye. Kyle&#39;s sports bra hung loose and empty despite the snug fit of the shell top. Cole&#39;s bodice, while creating impressive corseting effects, gaped slightly at the neckline where breasts should fill it.</p>
<p>&quot;Allow me to address that,&quot; Zelda said. She disappeared briefly behind the counter and returned holding what appeared to be-</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s stomach turned. They looked like pieces of flesh. Teardrop-shaped, skin-toned, with an unsettling realistic quality. They even had weight to them, moving with a slight jiggle as Zelda held them up.</p>
<p>&quot;What are those?&quot; Kyle asked, unable to hide the revulsion in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Just inserts to fill out the costume properly,&quot; Zelda said cheerfully, as if she were holding perfectly ordinary objects rather than something that looked disturbingly organic.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not-&quot; Kyle started to protest, but Zelda was already positioning them inside the sports bra, pressing the flesh-like forms against his flat chest.</p>
<p>They were warm. Warmer than they should have been. Kyle felt the heat immediately, spreading from where the inserts pressed against his skin. Not painful, but intense, unsettling, growing warmer by the second.</p>
<p>And then the inserts began to soften. To merge. He could feel it happening-their distinct edges blurring, melting into his chest like butter on hot bread. The foreign flesh was becoming his flesh. He could feel it on a deep level, a wrongness as two separate things became one.</p>
<p>Pressure built behind his ribs, a swelling that seemed to come from inside. His chest was expanding, the tissue multiplying, pushing outward to fill the space and then continuing beyond it. The bra that had hung empty was suddenly tight, stretched across actual breasts-full, heavy breasts that pulled at his shoulders with impossible weight.</p>
<p>Kyle looked down at himself in horror. When he breathed, they moved with him. When he shifted, they bounced with the terrible reality of actual flesh.</p>
<p>Zara had moved to Cole with larger forms-more substantial, more dramatic. She tucked them into the bodice before Cole could process what was happening.</p>
<p>The same warmth. The same horrible merging sensation as the flesh-like forms became actual flesh. The same deep pressure as his chest began to swell.</p>
<p>But Cole&#39;s transformation was more extreme. The forms Zara had used were designed for drama, for the kind of figure that would make the bodice strain. His chest expanded rapidly, filling the sweetheart neckline with full, prominent breasts that threatened to spill from the corseting entirely. Combined with his cinched waist, his figure had become dramatically curved-a bombshell silhouette that looked nothing like his original soft form.</p>
<p>Cole looked down at the breasts now straining against his bodice, then tried to take a step back from the mirror, to escape the horror of his reflection. His ankle immediately twisted in the unfamiliar heels and he grabbed for Kyle&#39;s now much-lower shoulder to keep from toppling over entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ll never make it to the party stumbling around like a newborn foal,&quot; Zara observed, watching his precarious balance. &quot;A maid should glide, not wobble.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Cole could respond, she was crouching before him, adjusting his ankle straps with a decisive click.</p>
<p>Cole took a tentative step, expecting the same precarious wobbling he&#39;d experienced since donning the shoes. Instead, his balance was perfect. He walked naturally, unconsciously graceful, the heels clicking against the floor as if he had been wearing them for years rather than minutes. His posture had shifted as well-more upright, shoulders back, the bearing of someone who understood how to carry themselves. It also had the effect of putting his newfound cleavage on full display to the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; Zelda said, producing two small bottles from the pockets of her cardigan, &quot;just a finishing touch to bring everything together.&quot;</p>
<p>Before either boy could react or protest, she spritzed the first bottle directly at Kyle-a sweet, cloying scent that evoked coffee shops and autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;What is-&quot; Kyle coughed as the scent enveloped him. It was not merely smell-he could feel it somehow, warm and heavy, sinking into his skin wherever the mist touched.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a special blend called Pumpkin Spice,&quot; Zelda said with evident pleasure.</p>
<p>Zara was already deploying the second bottle labeled &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; toward Cole-an elegant, sophisticated scent that smelled expensive, redolent of perfume counters in upscale department stores.</p>
<p>&quot;What-&quot; Cole started, but the scent hit him and his skin began to burn. Not painfully, but intensely, a tingling sensation spreading across every inch of exposed flesh.</p>
<p>The transformation was immediate. Kyle watched in the mirror as the hair on his arms simply disappeared, vanishing into smooth skin. His legs-visible above the white crew socks-went completely hairless in seconds, the dark hair that had covered them since puberty erasing itself as if it had never been.</p>
<p>But his skin tone was changing as well. His bronze complexion was lightening before his eyes, not slowly but with the speed of time-lapse photography. His forearms shifted from tan to pale cream. His legs became porcelain white. Every visible inch of his Asian complexion was bleaching out, transforming into something pale and smooth and utterly unlike his natural coloring.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh god,&quot; Kyle whispered, watching his ethnicity disappear from his reflection. &quot;What is this-my skin-&quot;</p>
<p>Cole was experiencing his own metamorphosis. His body hair was also vanishing. But his pale complexion was warming, taking on a golden, sun-kissed glow that looked as if he had spent the summer on some Mediterranean coast. His skin became luminous with that golden undertone, flawless and radiant in a way his natural complexion had never been.</p>
<p>&quot;You left your wigs!&quot; Zelda announced, disappearing briefly into Kyle&#39;s changing alcove. She returned bearing the platinum blonde wig with its high ponytail, while Zara retrieved a long auburn wig pulled into a soft updo.</p>
<p>&quot;Put these on,&quot; Zelda instructed.</p>
<p>Kyle pulled on the blonde wig with hands that would not stop trembling. It sat upon his head, obviously artificial, the cap edge visible against his forehead, the ponytail stiff and synthetic and clearly fake to anyone with functioning eyes.</p>
<p>Cole donned the auburn wig with equal lack of success. It looked precisely as bad as Kyle&#39;s-clearly artificial, the waves too perfect, the entire construction sitting wrong upon his head and fooling no one.</p>
<p>&quot;These look ridiculous,&quot; Cole observed.</p>
<p>&quot;They do,&quot; Zelda agreed with cheerful honesty. &quot;That&#39;s why we need to secure them properly. We can&#39;t have them falling off at your party, now can we?&quot;</p>
<p>She moved behind Kyle, fussing with the wig and adjusting its position with the care of a hairdresser. Then she began adding bobby pins-one at a time, pushing them into place with small, decisive movements.</p>
<p>With the first pin, Kyle felt a strange tingling in his scalp. Light, almost pleasant, like the beginning of an itch.</p>
<p>The second pin intensified the sensation, spreading it outward from the insertion point.</p>
<p>By the third pin, his face had begun to itch as well. Not painful but insistent, demanding, as if his skin were moving beneath itself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold still,&quot; Zelda murmured, adding a fourth pin, then a fifth, working methodically around his head.</p>
<p>Zara was performing the same service for Cole, carefully pinning his auburn wig into place.</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s face was changing. He could feel it-bones shifting beneath skin, cartilage reshaping, features softening. In the mirror, he watched with mounting horror as his nose shortened and narrowed, his lips plumped into something fuller and softer, his eyebrows thinned into elegant arches. His eyes appeared to grow larger, framed now by longer and darker lashes. His jawline softened, losing its angular masculinity. His cheekbones rose and became more pronounced.</p>
<p>The sharp, angular Asian features he had inherited from his parents-his father&#39;s strong jaw, his mother&#39;s elegant nose-were melting away like wax near flame. In their place emerged something completely different: a heart-shaped face with delicate, almost doll-like features. Large blue eyes where his dark brown ones had been. Soft, full lips. A small, upturned nose.</p>
<p>A beautiful young woman&#39;s face gazed back at him from the mirror, moving when he moved, expressing his horror with features that were not his own.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Kyle whispered, reaching up with one trembling hand to touch his transformed face. &quot;Oh no, no, no...&quot;</p>
<p>Cole&#39;s round, soft features were undergoing their own metamorphosis. His face narrowed to a heart-shape, his nose becoming small and refined, his lips achieving a natural pout that suggested sophistication. His eyes enlarged and became heavy-lidded, framed by thick, dark lashes that gave him a perpetually sultry expression. His jawline softened to an elegant curve. His cheekbones rose and sharpened, creating elegant planes that caught the light.</p>
<p>A striking, beautiful woman stared back from the mirror-sophisticated and sensual, the face of someone who belonged in fashion magazines or on catwalks, not in a college apartment studying philosophy.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; Zelda said, stepping back from Kyle with evident satisfaction. &quot;The wigs are securely attached now. Much more convincing, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle reached up carefully, touching the blonde hair as if it might burn him. It did not feel fake anymore. It felt real-like actual hair growing from his scalp, rooted and natural. He gave it a gentle experimental tug and winced as pain shot through his scalp, sharp and immediate.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it-&quot; His voice was shaking badly. &quot;Is this actually attached to my head now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very securely,&quot; Zelda confirmed with a warm smile. &quot;The pins did their job perfectly.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle and Cole exchanged looks in the mirror-looks of dawning comprehension mixed with desperate hope. The pins. The transformation had occurred as the pins were inserted. Therefore, if they removed the pins at the party, surely the wigs would come off. Surely their faces would return to normal. The logic was sound. It had to be sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Just need the finishing touches now,&quot; Zara announced brightly. She took the large red bow and pressed it firmly into place on Kyle&#39;s blonde ponytail with a definitive snap that seemed to echo in the quiet shop.</p>
<p>Tingling began in Kyle&#39;s throat immediately-warm, invasive, spreading through his vocal cords like liquid fire. The sensation moved into his mouth, into his sinuses, and then somehow into his brain itself, as if invisible fingers were reaching inside his skull and adjusting settings he had never known existed.</p>
<p>&quot;What-&quot; Kyle tried to say, but his voice was changing even as the word emerged, transforming mid-syllable into something else entirely. &quot;Like, what is that? Why does it feel so weird?&quot;</p>
<p>The voice that emerged from his mouth was not his own. Higher, breathier, with an enthusiastic Valley girl uptalk that made everything sound like a question, that turned statements into inquiries, that made him sound perpetually uncertain and vapid and young.</p>
<p>That was not his voice. That was not how he spoke. The inflection, the pitch, the idiotic uptalk-none of it was him.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect!&quot; Zara said with evident delight. &quot;And now you-&quot;</p>
<p>She moved towards Cole, reaching the small white lace cap towards his auburn wig. He tried to back away, to escape, to retain his voice as one last vestige of himself, but his back quickly pressed against the wall and he could retreat no further. Zara positioned the cap carefully, pinning it securely into place with a soft click that seemed to seal something irrevocable.</p>
<p>The same tingling, the same spreading warmth through throat and mouth and brain. Cole opened his mouth to protest, to demand an explanation-</p>
<p>&quot;Zis is-oh mon dieu-I sound like-&quot; Each word emerged breathy and accented, dripping with French inflection that made even his panic sound seductive and exotic. &quot;What &#39;ave you done to my voice?!&quot;</p>
<p>Every syllable was touched by that accent, every word shaped by those breathy tones. He tried again, concentrating fiercely, attempting to force his normal voice through sheer will.</p>
<p>&quot;How do I change eet back?&quot;</p>
<p>Still breathy. Still French. The accent clung to every sound he made, transforming his speech into something foreign and sensual.</p>
<p>&quot;The bow and the cap are part of the costume,&quot; Zelda explained with the patience of one addressing children. &quot;Just temporary attachments. When you&#39;re finished with them, you can remove them.&quot;</p>
<p>Temporary. Removable. The words brought a rush of relief to both boys. The bow and cap could be removed. They could remove them at the party, get their voices back, regain some control over this nightmare. Talk to the girls with their own voices.</p>
<p>They stood before the mirror, and what looked back at them bore no resemblance to the two young men who had entered this shop.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Kyle breathed-and the perky voice made even existential horror sound almost cheerful. &quot;Like, is that really us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; Cole whispered, and his breathy French accent made the simple affirmation sound like seduction. &quot;Zat is... zat is us now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect!&quot; Zelda clapped her hands together with evident satisfaction. &quot;You&#39;re all set for your party. What shall we call you girls tonight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re not-&quot; Kyle started, but it emerged as: &quot;Like, we&#39;re not actually girls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not, dear. You&#39;re just in costume!&quot; Zelda&#39;s smile was warm, understanding, completely without guile. &quot;But you need names for the party. You can hardly introduce yourselves as Kyle and Cole looking like that, can you? How about... Kylie? And Colette?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those aren&#39;t-&quot; Cole tried to protest, but his breathy French accent transformed it: &quot;Zose are not our names...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are tonight!&quot; Zara said brightly, with the finality of one who has made a decision that will not be questioned. &quot;Now, remember-the magic does its work tonight, and when Halloween is over, the spell completes. You&#39;ll have a wonderful time at your party!&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle-Kylie-reached for his wallet, the motion awkward with his new small hands and long nails. &quot;Like, how much do we owe you? For the costumes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, there&#39;s no charge,&quot; Zelda said, waving away the wallet with a generous gesture. &quot;Consider it our gift to you boys. We&#39;re just happy to help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We couldn&#39;t possibly accept payment,&quot; Zara insisted. &quot;However, we do ask one small thing. We&#39;ll need to keep your student IDs as collateral. Just until you return the costumes, of course. Simply a formality, to ensure you come back to us.&quot;</p>
<p>She held out her hand expectantly.</p>
<p>The boys-now-girls exchanged glances. It seemed reasonable enough-a deposit of sorts, insurance against theft or damage. They would return the costumes after the party, reclaim their IDs, and that would be the end of it.</p>
<p>Kyle reached for his wallet, his movements clumsy with the small, delicate hands the sisters had given him. The red nails-applied as simple press-ons that had somehow become inch-long, permanently affixed gel extensions-clicked against each other as he fumbled to extract his student ID. The card proclaimed him KYLE NGUYEN, with his photo and student number and major listed clearly. He handed it to Zelda with fingers that no longer felt entirely his own.</p>
<p>Cole produced his own ID with similar difficulty, his French-tipped nails tapping against the plastic-COLE RUSSO, with his round face staring out from the photo. He gave it to Zara.</p>
<p>The sisters accepted the cards with identical smiles, identical satisfaction, as if they had just been given something far more valuable than simple pieces of plastic.</p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Zelda said, tucking both IDs into her cardigan pocket. &quot;We&#39;ll keep these safe for you. Now off you go-you don&#39;t want to be late!&quot;</p>
<p>She ushered them toward the door with grandmotherly care. The bell chimed as they stepped into the October evening, two beautiful women in costume heading to a party they had been desperate to attend.</p>
<p>As the door closed behind them, Zelda and Zara remained in their shop, standing side by side, watching through the window as the two figures disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;They never ask the right questions,&quot; Zelda observed quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;They never do,&quot; Zara agreed.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>They walked in silence for a moment, two figures in the October darkness. Kyle&#39;s sneakers padded softly on the sidewalk. Cole&#39;s heels clicked with rhythmic precision, a sound he had never made before and yet now produced with unconscious grace. The cool air felt strange on Kyle&#39;s bare legs, on the exposed midriff that had never been exposed before. The weight on his chest pulled with each step, impossible to ignore. The crinoline rustled under Colette&#39;s skirt, catching the breeze and requiring constant vigilance lest it rise and expose what lay beneath.</p>
<p>&quot;Like, so the plan is still the same, right?&quot; Kyle said, and even to his own ears the perky voice sounded absurd, discussing strategy in tones more suited to discussing nail polish or shopping. &quot;We get to the party, find a bathroom, take off the bow and the cap so our voices go back to normal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; Colette agreed, though the breathy French accent made even simple agreement sound like an invitation to something more intimate. &quot;And we remove ze bobby pins so ze wigs come off. Zen our faces will look normal again, non?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, like, exactly!&quot; Kyle felt marginally better with a plan, however uncertain. &quot;And the sisters said we can take off the costumes after the party. So the body stuff-like, all this-&quot; he gestured at himself with those small hands and their red gel nails &quot;-that&#39;ll go away when we take off the costume, right? Or at least when Halloween ends at midnight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zey said ze spell completes at midnight,&quot; Colette said carefully, his accent curling around each word. &quot;So everyzing should... reverse? Go back to normal?&quot;</p>
<p>Neither sounded entirely convinced of this interpretation, but they needed to believe it. The alternative-that they might be trapped in these forms, these voices, these bodies-was too terrible to contemplate fully.</p>
<p>&quot;And once we take off the bow and cap and remove the pins, Jessica and Emma will be able to recognize us,&quot; Kyle continued, working through the logic as if reason still applied to their circumstances. &quot;Like, our faces will look normal again, our voices will sound normal, and we can explain about the costumes. They&#39;ll probably think it&#39;s funny that we crashed the party this way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; Colette agreed, though doubt colored even that single syllable. &quot;Zey will zink it is... amusing? Zat we went to such lengths to attend.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked another block in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, each trying desperately to ignore the wrongness of their bodies, their voices, their reflections in every dark window they passed. Two beautiful women in Halloween costumes, heading to a party, convinced they had a plan to salvage the evening.</p>

        </figure>
        
<p>The Sigma Chi house announced itself from blocks away with the throb of bass that Kyle could feel in his chest. In his new chest, which moved with the vibration in ways both unfamiliar and deeply uncomfortable. Heat and noise spilled from the building as they approached, costumes visible through the windows and scattered across the lawn. Every eye seemed to turn toward them as they walked up the path.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god, like, everyone&#39;s totally staring?&quot; Kylie&#39;s voice made even nervousness sound cheerful.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we look like zis,&quot; Cole muttered, the breathy accent making even frustration sound seductive.</p>
<p>But they were waved through the door immediately, as if their entry had never been in question. No names checked, no list consulted. Two pretty girls in costume-of course they could enter. Of course they belonged.</p>
<p>The validation made it somehow worse.</p>
<p>Inside was overwhelming in its assault on the senses. Bodies pressed together in the heat, the air thick with cheap beer and cheaper cologne and the particular musk of too many people in too small a space. People were everywhere-superheroes and zombies and vampires all crammed into the main room, shouting over the music, drinks sloshing, hands reaching and touching and grabbing.</p>
<p>&quot;Bathroom?&quot; Kyle said immediately, grabbing Cole&#39;s arm with his small hand. &quot;Like, we need to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui, now.&quot;</p>
<p>They pushed through the crowd toward the back of the house. Kyle kept getting jostled-he was so much shorter now that people simply did not see him, bumping into him without noticing, without apology. Someone&#39;s costume caught his ponytail and yanked it backward, making him yelp with genuine pain. The blonde hair whipped around when he turned his head seeking the culprit, getting in his mouth, in his eyes, a constant annoyance.</p>
<p>Cole was experiencing different difficulties. The crinoline made his skirt poof out to such width that he kept catching it on people, on furniture, on doorframes. When someone pushed past him from the front, the physics of the crinoline caused it to tilt upward in back-Cole felt the air on his upper thighs and reached back frantically to shove the skirt down, hoping desperately that no one had glimpsed the ruffled panties beneath.</p>
<p>They finally reached a bathroom and locked themselves inside, away from the chaos. Under the harsh fluorescent light, they looked even more surreal-two beautiful women in costume, makeup still perfect despite the heat, expressions panicked.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Kyle said, reaching for his ponytail with trembling hands. &quot;Like, let&#39;s just take off the bow and-&quot;</p>
<p>He grabbed the red bow and pulled with force.</p>
<p>Pain shot through his scalp immediately, sharp and intense and utterly genuine. He yelped, tears springing to his eyes from the sheer unexpected agony of it. The bow did not budge. It was not attached to the wig. It was attached to his actual head, by his actual hair, as much a part of him as his fingers or his toes.</p>
<p>&quot;It won&#39;t-&quot; He pulled harder, desperate now, and the pain intensified until he had to release it or risk pulling out chunks of his own hair. &quot;Like, it&#39;s not coming off! It&#39;s my actual hair!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Non, non, non-&quot; Cole was frantically feeling through his auburn waves, searching for the bobby pins they had watched the sisters insert. His fingers found nothing. No pins. No cap edge where the wig met his scalp. Just hair-his own hair, growing naturally from his own head. And that small white lace cap seemed to be part of his actual head somehow, the pins that secured it not metal and removable but somehow fused into his skull. &quot;Ze pins-zey are gone! It is just &#39;air! My &#39;air!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god, oh my god.&quot; Kylie&#39;s voice was rising in panic, the cheerful uptalk making terror sound almost enthusiastic. &quot;Like, we can&#39;t take off the wigs? And the bow won&#39;t come off? So we&#39;re stuck like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until midnight,&quot; Cole said, forcing himself to breathe, to think, to find some rational framework for the irrational. &quot;Ze sisters said ze spell completes when &#39;Alloween ends. So at midnight, we change back. We just &#39;ave to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like, two and a half more hours?&quot; Kyle looked at his reflection, at the pretty blonde cheerleader with the panicked blue eyes. &quot;We can just... wait it out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui.&quot; Cole was trying to sound more confident than he felt, trying to be the voice of reason even though reason had abandoned them hours ago. &quot;We stick eet out. But-&quot; he met Kyle&#39;s eyes in the mirror &quot;-we can still do somezing useful, non? We can still talk to Jessica and Emma.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they won&#39;t recognize us like this?&quot; Kyle gestured at his transformed face, his pale skin, his delicate features that bore no resemblance to Kyle Nguyen.</p>
<p>&quot;So we make zem want to date Kyle and Cole,&quot; Cole said, warming to the idea as one does when desperate for any plan, any purpose. &quot;We find out what zey like in men. We talk up our real selves. Zen when we change back at midnight, zey will already be interested!&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s face brightened slightly, hope kindling in those large blue eyes. &quot;Oh my god, like, that&#39;s actually really smart? We can totally do that!&quot;</p>
<p>They looked at each other in the mirror, finding new purpose in the revised plan. It was not ideal. It was, perhaps, not even good. But it was something, some way to salvage meaning from this nightmare.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Kyle said, squaring his shoulders in a gesture of determination-which made his breasts shift in the tight top. &quot;Like, let&#39;s do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Allons-y,&quot; Cole agreed, the French phrase feeling both natural and completely alien on his tongue.</p>
<p>They pushed back out into the chaos of the party, into the heat and noise and press of bodies, armed with a new plan and a desperate hope that midnight would bring salvation.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The plan began its collapse almost immediately.</p>
<p>Kyle attempted to navigate through the crowd toward where he had glimpsed Jessica earlier, but being short transformed every movement into a struggle. He could not see over anyone. People bumped into him constantly, not noticing him in the press of bodies, not registering his presence until after they had already made contact. Someone stepped directly on his foot and he stumbled, nearly falling.</p>
<p>A hand caught his waist, steadying him. The touch was familiar in its presumption, unwelcome in its intimacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, careful there.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle looked up-far up-at a man dressed as a pirate. He stood easily six inches taller than Kyle now, and his hand remained on Kyle&#39;s waist, fingers spread across the bare skin of his exposed midriff with casual ownership.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks?&quot; Kyle tried to step back but the crowd was too dense, offered no escape route.</p>
<p>&quot;No problem. You here alone?&quot; The man&#39;s eyes dropped to Kyle&#39;s chest, lingering on the cheer top with the kind of assessment that made Kyle&#39;s skin crawl. &quot;I&#39;m Brad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m actually looking for my friend-&quot; Kyle tried to move past him but Brad shifted to block his path, as if Kyle&#39;s stated intention meant nothing compared to Brad&#39;s desire to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me get you a drink first. What do cute little cheerleaders drink?&quot;</p>
<p>The way he said &quot;cute little&quot;-as if Kyle were a particularly appealing variety of small animal-made something inside Kyle recoil. He grabbed Brad&#39;s wrist with his small hand and removed it from his waist with more force than politeness demanded. &quot;Like, I really need to find my friend? Thanks though?&quot;</p>
<p>He ducked away before Brad could respond, pushing deeper into the crowd. His ponytail whipped around as he turned his head trying to spot Jessica, the blonde hair getting in his face, catching on his lips. He shoved it back impatiently with those red-nailed fingers.</p>
<p>Someone else grabbed him from behind-hands on his hips, pulling him backward against them with presumption that suggested ownership rather than invitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey gorgeous-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like, no!&quot; Kyle twisted away, heart pounding with a fear that was new and terrible and specifically feminine in its contours. The skirt was so short that any sudden movement threatened to expose him completely, to reveal more than he wished to reveal. He tugged it down with one hand while pushing through the crowd with the other, hyperaware of eyes on his body, on his legs, on his chest, on his exposed midriff.</p>
<p>He felt like prey. He felt like something to be pursued and captured. And he hated it with an intensity that made his throat tight and his eyes sting with tears he refused to shed.</p>
<p>Across the room, Cole was navigating his own particular nightmare.</p>
<p>The crinoline and crowd made movement nearly impossible. He attempted to squeeze between two men engaged in conversation and the skirt caught on someone&#39;s belt buckle. When he pulled forward to free himself, he felt the air on his upper thighs, on the curve of his ass barely covered by the ruffled panties, and reached back frantically to shove the fabric down, face burning with humiliation.</p>
<p>&quot;Excusez moi,&quot; he said, trying to extract himself with dignity. The breathy French accent transformed the simple phrase into something that sounded like bedroom talk.</p>
<p>Both men turned, their eyes immediately dropping to his cleavage rather than his face. The sweetheart neckline of the bodice was cut low, and every movement made his breasts jiggle and threaten to spill out entirely, a constant source of anxiety that made him want to cross his arms over his chest like a shield.</p>
<p>&quot;Well hello,&quot; one of them said, grinning in a way that made Cole&#39;s skin crawl. &quot;Where are you from? That accent is sexy as hell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am just trying to get past-&quot; But the accent made even this sound flirtatious, made it sound like an invitation rather than a dismissal.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay and talk to us,&quot; the other one interrupted, moving to block his path. &quot;I&#39;m always saying we need more international students at these parties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, I must go-&quot; He tried to turn but the crinoline caught on a side table, knocking over plastic cups in a cascade. Beer sloshed across the floor and onto his costume.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, careful!&quot; Someone laughed. &quot;That dress is dangerous!&quot;</p>
<p>Cole felt his face burning-Colette&#39;s face, now golden and beautiful and mortified beyond measure. He finally extracted himself and fled toward a quieter corner, the heels clicking with each step, his breasts bouncing with movement he could not control and could not prevent.</p>
<p>He needed to find Emma. That was the plan. Find Emma, determine what she found attractive in men, speak well of Cole, plant the seeds of interest that would bloom when he returned to his proper form at midnight.</p>
<p>But the party was so loud, so crowded, and every word that emerged from his mouth sounded like seduction whether he wished it or not. How could he have a genuine conversation about anything when his very voice transformed meaning?</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Midnight inched ever closer, but the boys could not locate Jessica or Emma in the chaos and crush of bodies. They would not need to. The sisters would keep their word, as they always did. Kyle and Cole would speak to Jessica and Emma tonight. They would have the girls&#39; full attention, their sympathy, their care. The tragedy that would unfold was not in the promise breaking, but in its keeping.</p>
<p>From across the room, Jessica Miller noticed. She had been engaged in conversation with friends, but the sight of a small blonde cheerleader looking on the verge of tears caught her attention. The girl looked so overwhelmed, so out of place, so clearly in need of rescue from whatever was causing her distress.</p>
<p>Emma Laurent noticed as well, from a different angle. The tall auburn-haired maid was obviously upset, her elegant face twisted with frustration and something approaching despair. She looked like she needed help, like she needed someone to intervene before whatever was happening escalated further.</p>
<p>Jessica, in a moment of sisterly sympathy, moved to help. Emma, from another angle entirely, did the same. They did not coordinate. They did not communicate. They simply moved at precisely the same moment, drawn by forces neither could have named, fulfilling promises made by sisters who understood the architecture of fate.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Jessica said gently, touching Kyle&#39;s shoulder with genuine concern. &quot;Are you okay? That looked pretty intense.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle spun around, his ponytail whipping dramatically, and found himself looking up-always up now, always from below-at Jessica Miller. Jessica, who he had been building courage to approach for six weeks. Jessica, who was looking at him now with genuine concern and kindness, seeing someone in distress and responding with empathy.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Um, like, yeah?&quot; Kyle tried to compose himself, wiping at his eyes with those small hands. &quot;I&#39;m fine? Just, you know, party stress?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to sit down somewhere quieter?&quot; Jessica asked, her voice kind and her intention clearly protective. &quot;You look like you could use a break from all this chaos.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same moment, Emma was approaching Cole with similar concern. &quot;Are you alright? I saw you knock over those drinks...&quot;</p>
<p>Cole turned, and there was Emma Laurent. Emma, who Cole had been trying to work up the courage to really engage with for weeks. Emma, who was looking at him now with sympathy and concern, responding to visible distress with human kindness.</p>
<p>&quot;Oui, I am...&quot; Cole struggled for words that would not sound seductive, that would convey genuine emotion rather than invitation. &quot;I am just &#39;aving a difficult night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Emma said, gesturing toward a slightly quieter side room. &quot;Let&#39;s get you away from all this chaos for a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle let Jessica guide him toward the back porch, away from the noise and heat. Cole followed Emma toward a side room being used for coats, less crowded and quieter than the main party.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Jessica found them a spot on a bench, away from the main crush of people still smoking and drinking and shouting. &quot;God, you must be freezing in that outfit. Do you want to head back inside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Kyle said quickly, perhaps too quickly. &quot;Like, I&#39;m fine? I just needed some air?&quot;</p>
<p>He wasn&#39;t fine. The October chill bit at his exposed midriff, his bare legs, raising goosebumps on skin that was too pale and too smooth. But going back inside meant more grabbing, more eyes on his body, more noise. Out here he could at least think.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#39;re sure,&quot; Jessica said, though her expression suggested doubt. After a moment, she shifted closer and put her body against Kyle&#39;s, a gesture of casual warmth. &quot;At least let me help a little.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle froze. This was what he had wanted-to be close to Jessica, to have her attention, to matter to her. He had imagined this moment dozens of times over the past six weeks. Her body next to him. Her warmth. Her choosing to be near him.</p>
<p>Just not like this. Not in this body. Not as Kylie while Kyle remained invisible and erased.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m Jessica, by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kylie.&quot; The name still felt foreign on his tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;So like,&quot; Kyle said, trying to focus, trying to salvage something from this nightmare, &quot;the guys at this party are so gross. Are you, um, seeing anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>Jessica laughed. &quot;No, I&#39;m single. These parties are usually more stressful than fun, honestly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! So like, what kind of guy are you into?&quot;</p>
<p>Jessica shrugged, considering the question. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Someone genuine, I guess? Someone who doesn&#39;t feel the need to constantly prove how smart they are. Someone who actually listens when you talk instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s heart sank slightly even as hope tried to maintain its grip. That could describe him-he was smart, he did listen. Maybe this would work. &quot;What about like, guys from your classes? Anyone interesting?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not really.&quot; Jessica made a face. &quot;Most of the guys in my econ class are either completely checked out or super annoying about how smart they think they are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about, um-&quot; Kyle tried to sound casual &quot;-what about Kyle? Kyle Nguyen? Like, isn&#39;t he in your econ class?&quot;</p>
<p>Jessica actually rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh god, yes. Kyle. Perfect example of exactly what I was just talking about.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s stomach dropped as if the bench had suddenly fallen out from under him. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s kind of a blowhard, honestly.&quot; Jessica&#39;s tone was matter-of-fact. &quot;Always going on about game theory like he&#39;s discovered something revolutionary. Always has to prove he&#39;s the smartest person in the room, even when nobody asked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But like-maybe he&#39;s just passionate about economics?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s enthusiastic and then there&#39;s needing everyone to know you&#39;re smarter than them,&quot; Jessica said. &quot;He answered a question in class last week and then spent five minutes explaining why his answer was better than the professor&#39;s. It was painful to watch.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle remembered that moment. He had thought he was contributing meaningfully. He had thought Jessica might be impressed by his willingness to challenge conventional thinking.</p>
<p>He had been wrong about all of it.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s not a bad person or anything,&quot; Jessica added. &quot;Just kind of oblivious to how he comes across. Why, is he a friend of yours or something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Kyle said quickly. &quot;Just, like, curious?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you can do better than Kyle Nguyen,&quot; Jessica said with warmth. &quot;You seem really sweet, actually.&quot;</p>
<p>And then Jessica opened up. She talked about her classes, her frustrations with campus culture, her dreams of making a real difference in the world. She was funny and insightful and passionate, everything Kyle had imagined she would be when given the chance to speak freely.</p>
<p>She was talking to Kylie like a friend, like someone worth her time.</p>
<p>All the things she had never done with Kyle, whom she found annoying and oblivious.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m really glad I met you tonight,&quot; Jessica said as their conversation wound down. &quot;You&#39;re really easy to talk to. We should hang out sometime-like actually hang out, not just at these awful parties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be, like, really great?&quot; Kyle managed, his voice catching on the terrible irony of finally getting what he wanted in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>Jessica squeezed his shoulder gently. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go find your friend. Make sure she&#39;s okay.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Emma had found a relatively clear spot among the jackets and bags piled on a table and folding chairs. Cole stood awkwardly, the crinoline making sitting impossible without taking up far too much space and revealing far too much leg.</p>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; Emma said with a friendly smile, &quot;what brings you to Sigma Chi? You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re having the greatest time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not,&quot; Cole admitted, the accent making the confession sound dramatic. &quot;&#39;Onestly, I do not know why I came &#39;ere at all. Zis-&quot; he gestured at the voluminous skirt &quot;-zis poufy zeeeng, it is impossible!&quot;</p>
<p>As Emma stifled a laugh, a man appeared in the doorway-tall, athletic, wearing a basketball jersey. He grinned when he saw Emma.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are! I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you.&quot; He possessively slid his arm around Emma&#39;s waist. &quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Matt, this is...&quot; Emma looked at Cole expectantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Colette,&quot; Cole managed, his heart sinking. Boyfriend. Of course Emma had a boyfriend. They barely spoke outside of class. He knew nothing of her personal life. He had projected his hopes onto her without considering reality.</p>
<p>&quot;Colette,&quot; Matt repeated, his eyes traveling down Cole&#39;s body. &quot;Cool. Love the accent.&quot; Before Cole could respond, Matt was calling out the door: &quot;Tony! Get in here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Matt,&quot; Emma said with mild exasperation, &quot;don&#39;t just summon people-&quot;</p>
<p>But Tony was already appearing in the doorway-another athlete in a football jersey, shorter than Matt but solidly built. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is Colette,&quot; Matt said, gesturing toward Cole. &quot;Colette, this is Tony. We&#39;re on the team together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Allo,&quot; managed Cole, eyes scanning for an exit.</p>
<p>Tony&#39;s eyes lit up with obvious interest. &quot;Hey. Wow. That accent is amazing. Where are you from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;France,&quot; Cole lied.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s awesome,&quot; Tony said enthusiastically. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to visit Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Emma&#39;s expression shifted. The frustration that had flickered when Matt summoned Tony gave way to something else-consideration, calculation, then something that looked almost like relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Colette was just telling me she doesn&#39;t really know anyone here on campus,&quot; Emma said, distorting what Cole had actually said. &quot;I was thinking maybe you two should talk? Get to know each other?&quot;</p>
<p>Understanding dawned on Cole with sick inevitability. Emma wasn&#39;t being kind. She was solving a problem-the problem of her boyfriend&#39;s friend who was always around, always third-wheeling, always preventing the alone time couples naturally desired.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s a great idea,&quot; Matt said immediately. &quot;You two should definitely hang out.&quot;</p>
<p>Tony moved closer with obvious interest. &quot;Do you want to get some air?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, we were about to step outside anyway,&quot; Matt said, already steering Emma toward the door. &quot;You two should grab drinks, talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Emma smiled at Cole with encouragement, clearly thinking she was being helpful. &quot;It was really nice meeting you, Colette!&quot;</p>
<p>And then Matt was guiding Emma out, creating the alone time he wanted, solving the third-wheel problem by pawning Tony off onto the pretty French girl who had appeared so conveniently.</p>
<p>Tony remained, looking hopeful. &quot;So... that drink? Or we could just talk here if you prefer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really need to find my friend,&quot; Cole said. &quot;I am sorry, but I should make sure she is okay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Yeah, of course.&quot; Tony looked disappointed. &quot;Well, if you change your mind, I&#39;ll be around.&quot;</p>
<p>Cole extracted himself from the coat room, the crinoline catching on the doorframe again in now-familiar humiliation. He needed to find Kyle. Needed to escape this place. Needed to be anywhere but here.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>They found each other near the front door at almost the same moment, both looking devastated.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to go,&quot; Kyle said, his perky voice barely holding together, on the edge of breaking entirely. &quot;Like, right now? I can&#39;t stay here until midnight. I just can&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; Cole agreed, accent thick with unshed tears. &quot;We leave now. Zis was a disaster. A complete disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>They slipped out the door without saying goodbye to anyone, both eager to escape, both desperate for air and quiet and distance from the nightmare the party had become.</p>
<p>The October night was cold on Kyle&#39;s exposed skin. Cole&#39;s heels clicked on the sidewalk, his elegant French-tipped nails clutching the fabric of his skirt with the desperation of someone who had suffered too many wardrobe malfunctions already.</p>
<p>They walked a full block in heavy silence, each processing their own particular failures and disappointments.</p>
<p>&quot;Jessica thinks Kyle is a blowhard,&quot; Kyle said quietly, his cheerful uptalk unable to disguise the pain beneath the words. &quot;Like, she actually used that word. She said he&#39;s annoying and needs everyone to know he&#39;s smart and she finds him exhausting.&quot;</p>
<p>Cole winced in sympathy. &quot;Emma &#39;as a boyfriend. And she-&quot; he swallowed hard &quot;-she zinks I would be perfect for &#39;is friend-to keep &#39;im occupied!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god, that&#39;s awful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She wants to get coffee and talk more. Because she zinks I would be perfect for Tony, so zey can double-date and Tony will stop being wiz zem all ze time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jessica wants to be friends with Kylie,&quot; Kyle said, matching hollowness in his perky tones. &quot;She doesn&#39;t even see Kyle as worth talking to, but Kylie? Kylie she wants to be friends with.&quot;</p>
<p>They both fell silent again, the weight of these revelations settling over them like fog.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what is funny?&quot; Cole said after another block, though nothing in his tone suggested actual humor. &quot;Ze sisters-zey guaranteed we would get closer to Jessica and Emma tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle barked out a short, bitter laugh. &quot;Like, they were totally right? We did get closer to them? Just not in any way we actually wanted?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui. Zey were very careful wiz zeir words, non?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>They climbed the stairs to their apartment in silence, two beautiful women in costume, completely defeated. The party had been worse than a disaster-it had been a revelation of truths they had not wanted to know. They had learned who they actually were through the cruel mirror of other people&#39;s perceptions.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Ow much longer until midnight?&quot; Cole asked as Kyle fumbled with the keys, his small hands and long nails making the simple task unexpectedly difficult.</p>
<p>Kyle pulled out his phone to check the time. The screen showed 11:42. &quot;Like, twenty minutes? We just... we wait?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We wait,&quot; Cole agreed heavily.</p>
<p>They let themselves into the apartment and stood in their living room, still in full costume. Their familiar space surrounded them-the couch where they had sat mere hours ago, the TV that had been showing some forgotten program, the remnants of their normal lives scattered around them.</p>
<p>Everything about the apartment looked the same, except for the two people who lived there. That was about to change, the boys hoped, when the spell completed at midnight. And it would.</p>
<p>If only they had asked what &quot;complete&quot; actually meant.</p>
<p>They collapsed onto the couch, still in full costume. Kyle pulled out his phone to check the time again. 11:47. They sat in silence, the minutes advancing with the cruel slowness of watched time. 11:52. 11:56. 11:59.</p>
<p>Kyle held his breath, his small hands clenched into fists. Cole sat with perfect posture even in his exhaustion, the crinoline spreading around him on the couch like a statement of the space he now required in the world.</p>
<p>The clock struck midnight.</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing happened. Their bodies remained unchanged. Only the date on Kyle&#39;s phone shifted, marking the transition from October 31st to November 1st.</p>
<p>Then both their phones buzzed simultaneously with incoming messages.</p>
<p>Kyle grabbed his phone with trembling hands, those red gel nails clicking against the screen. A text from Jessica Miller appeared.</p>
<p>*thx for listening 2nite, u always know exactly what to say! miss u already! brunch Sunday like always?*</p>
<p>&quot;What the-&quot; Kyle stared at the message, reading it twice, three times, trying to make sense of words that made no sense. &quot;Like, what does she mean &#39;like always&#39;?&quot;</p>
<p>Cole was staring at his own phone, his face going pale beneath the golden skin. A text from Emma Laurent glowed on his screen.</p>
<p>*ur the best! Matt wont shut up about how perfect you n Tony would be lol. thx for being so cool about everything. luv u!*</p>
<p>&quot;Zis does not make sense,&quot; Cole said slowly, carefully, as if speaking too quickly might shatter what remained of reality. &quot;She is texting like-like we are already friends. Like we &#39;ave known each ozzer for much longer zan one night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did they even get our numbers?&quot; Kyle interrupted, panic rising in his voice like flood water. &quot;Like, we never gave them our numbers? We never exchanged contact information at all?&quot;</p>
<p>Cole was already scrolling upward through his messages with Emma, his elegant fingers moving with increasing speed across the screen. His face went from pale to ashen.</p>
<p>The conversation extended backward. And backward. And backward still.</p>
<p>Weeks of messages. Months, even. Casual conversations about classes and life and the small frustrations of college existence. Inside jokes that Cole did not remember making. References to shared experiences that had never occurred.</p>
<p>All with Emma Laurent, discussing everything from philosophy to Matt&#39;s annoying habits to Tony&#39;s perpetual third-wheel status. Sharing memes and complaints and the ordinary intimacies of friendship.</p>
<p>Messages Cole had never sent. Conversations Cole had never had. A friendship that had never existed.</p>
<p>But they were there. On his phone. In his message history. Documented and dated and entirely real.</p>
<p>&quot;Mon dieu,&quot; Cole whispered, the words barely audible. &quot;Kyle, look at your phone. Scroll up through ze messages.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle did, his small hands shaking so badly he nearly dropped the device. The same phenomenon greeted him-months of messages with Jessica Miller. Talking about economics class and campus drama and boys and all the ordinary concerns of young women navigating college together. Making plans for coffee and brunch and study sessions. Complaining about classes and professors and the general unfairness of life.</p>
<p>Conversations about things Kylie had apparently done, places Kylie had apparently been, opinions Kylie had apparently expressed.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn&#39;t-&quot; Kyle started, but then he stopped.</p>
<p>Because something in the apartment was changing.</p>
<p>It started subtly, as these things often do when they wish to avoid immediate notice. A poster on the wall-the gaming poster above the TV-was rippling. Not dramatically, not violently, but with the gentle insistence of water reshaping stone over centuries. The image blurred and shifted, colors bleeding and reforming into something new.</p>
<p>When it settled, it showed pink and white text in casual script: GOOD VIBES ONLY</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Kyle jumped to his feet, the short skirt threatening to expose him as he moved. &quot;Did you see that?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ze poster-&quot; Cole was staring, his eyes wide with dawning horror.</p>
<p>Kyle was already running toward his bedroom, some instinct driving him to witness what was coming, to see the full extent of what was being taken from him. &quot;Like, oh my god, if that changed, what about everything else-&quot;</p>
<p>He threw open his bedroom door without bothering to slow down.</p>
<p>His room was transforming before his eyes, reality rewriting itself with casual inevitability.</p>
<p>The blue comforter on his bed was shifting to pink, the fabric rippling as if underwater before settling into its new color. His posters were all melting and reforming like wax sculptures near flame. Band posters became cheer competition photos, glossy and bright with girls frozen mid-jump. Gaming posters transformed into motivational quotes in cursive script. The periodic table dissolved entirely, replaced by a mirror with fairy lights around its frame.</p>
<p>His desk was sprouting new items as if they were growing from the wood itself. Pink notebooks appearing from nothing. A cheerleader teddy bear materializing in his chair. Trophies rising up like mushrooms after rain, each topped with a small gold cheerleader frozen in eternal enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no-&quot; Kyle moved to his bookshelf, reaching for his textbooks as if physical contact might anchor them to their original forms.</p>
<p>His textbooks were changing before his touch could reach them. He watched in horror as Principles of Microeconomics-the copy he had highlighted and annotated meticulously all semester, his thoughts and insights recorded in the margins-twisted and reshaped itself. The cover bled away like watercolors in rain, reformed into something new. Sports Marketing Fundamentals stared back at him in cheerful block letters.</p>
<p>His copy of Game Theory was becoming Event Planning and Management. His worn paperback of Freakonomics twisted into Introduction to Kinesiology. Book after book, transforming into subjects he had never studied, would never have chosen, could not imagine caring about.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyle!&quot; Cole&#39;s voice came from across the hall, panicked and breathy and wrong. &quot;&#39;Ow is zis &#39;appening?! &#39;Ow is any of zis possible?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like, all my stuff is changing!&quot; Kyle shouted across the narrow space.</p>
<p>&quot;Mine aussi!&quot; Cole gestured behind him frantically, his movements making his breasts bounce and his crinoline rustle. &quot;My philosophy books-zey are becoming fashion magazines! French novels! Everyzing I &#39;ave studied, everyzing I &#39;ave worked for-it is all disappearing!&quot;</p>
<p>Kyle turned back to his own room, seeking what new horror had manifested. The photos on his desk were changing before his eyes.</p>
<p>The picture of him and his high school friends at graduation-the photo he had looked at countless times, the faces as familiar to him as his own-was shifting. The faces were morphing, bones restructuring beneath skin, features melting and reforming into strangers. The boys were becoming girls. The casual clothes were becoming cheer uniforms. The entire composition was rewriting itself.</p>
<p>When it finished, the photo showed a group of cheerleaders at what appeared to be a competition, all of them grinning with their arms around each other. In the center stood Kylie-petite, blonde, beaming-with her arms around girls Kyle had never met, who existed only in this rewritten history.</p>
<p>Kyle looked around his room wildly, desperately, seeking something to anchor himself to reality. Everything was changing. His gaming setup in the corner was dissolving like sugar in water, reshaping into a makeup vanity-white and pink with a large mirror surrounded by lights that seemed to promise endless hours of primping and preparation. His simple blue curtains were becoming pink with white ruffles, the kind of curtains that belonged in a little girl&#39;s room rather than a college student&#39;s space.</p>
<p>Even his laundry basket was transforming, his clothes inside shifting from jeans and hoodies to crop tops and cheer shorts and things pink and feminine and utterly wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to take off ze costumes!&quot; Cole shouted from his room. &quot;Maybe zat will stop it! Maybe if we-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Kyle was already grabbing at his cheer top, yanking it over his head with frantic haste. The blonde ponytail whipped around as the shell came off, hair getting in his mouth and eyes. He threw the top on the floor as if it were contaminated and reached for the sports bra.</p>
<p>His eyes caught his reflection in the full-length mirror that hung on his closet door-a mirror that had definitely not been there before.</p>
<p>A petite blonde girl in a cheerleader skirt and sports bra stared back at him, her face panicked and tear-streaked.</p>
<p>Kyle tore his eyes away and pulled off the bra. The girl&#39;s breasts bounced free-full, heavy, topped with small pink nipples that had no business existing on his body. He grabbed at them desperately, feeling the weight, the softness, the way they moved independently of his control.</p>
<p>Real. Completely real. No illusion, no trick of padding or positioning. Actual breasts made of actual flesh attached to his actual body.</p>
<p>&quot;Like, they&#39;re still here!&quot; he shouted toward Cole&#39;s room, his voice approaching hysteria. &quot;They&#39;re not going away! Nothing&#39;s going away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mine eizzer!&quot; Cole&#39;s voice came back, strained and panicked and breaking.</p>
<p>Kyle shoved down the skirt, then the spankies, stripping frantically until he stood in just the white socks and sneakers. Completely exposed. Completely vulnerable. Completely transformed.</p>
<p>And he made himself look in the mirror-really look, take full inventory of what had been done to him.</p>
<p>The girl staring back was naked except for socks and shoes. Petite frame that now stood no more than 5&#39;4&quot;. Pale porcelain skin with no trace of the Asian heritage that had shaped Kyle&#39;s features and colored his complexion. Toned cheerleader body with muscle definition in the abs and legs. Breasts that shouldn&#39;t exist sitting high and firm on his chest. Hips that curved, thighs that were smooth and soft and shaped wrong.</p>
<p>And between his legs-</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Where everything should have been, where Kyle&#39;s male anatomy had existed for his entire life, there was only smooth skin. A gentle curve. The unmistakable configuration of female genitalia.</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s hands shook as he reached down, touching himself with trembling fingers and those ridiculous red nails. He had to know. Had to confirm the full extent of the transformation even though part of him was screaming not to look, not to acknowledge, not to make it real by witnessing it.</p>
<p>Soft lips met his touch. Sensitive folds that sent unfamiliar sensations through his nervous system when his fingers made contact. He could feel the small hooded bump of a clitoris, more sensitive than anything he had ever experienced. Below that, the opening to a vagina, the entrance to internal anatomy that should not exist.</p>
<p>He pressed his finger inside slightly-just slightly, just enough to confirm-and felt the walls of a vaginal canal, felt muscles contract around his intrusion, felt the intimate reality of female anatomy that was now his own.</p>
<p>His penis was gone. His testicles were gone. Everything that had made him male had been replaced with fully functional female genitalia. A complete vulva with all its component parts. A vagina that presumably connected to a uterus and ovaries and all the internal structures that made someone biologically female.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Kyle whispered, his perky voice breaking on the words. &quot;Oh my god, it&#39;s really gone. Like, all of it. There&#39;s a-there&#39;s actually a-I can feel inside and there&#39;s actually-&quot;</p>
<p>He could not finish. Could not articulate the full horror of it. He just stood there, naked in front of the mirror, one hand between his legs feeling the impossible reality while tears ran down his pretty face and dripped onto his pretty breasts.</p>
<p>Across the hall, Cole was having his own reckoning with reality.</p>
<p>He had stripped out of the maid costume frantically-the dress, the corset, the apron, all of it thrown aside in desperate haste. He stood in just the stockings and heels in front of his own mirror-a mirror that had transformed from simple and functional to ornate and elegant, framed in gold like something from a palace.</p>
<p>His room was transforming around him but he barely registered it. The minimalist furniture becoming elegant and sophisticated. His bookshelf full of philosophy becoming full of French novels and fashion theory and glossy magazines that promised to teach him about trends and style. Fashion sketches appearing on his walls, framed and professional, as if Cole had created them himself.</p>
<p>But none of that mattered compared to what he saw in the mirror.</p>
<p>A tall, statuesque woman with auburn waves and golden skin. Elegant features with heavy-lidded eyes that made every expression look sultry. The face of someone who belonged in fashion magazines or on runways, not in college apartments studying existentialism.</p>
<p>And a body to match. Long willowy legs in sheer stockings made even longer by the heels. A dramatically cinched waist that created an hourglass figure. Full breasts with dusky nipples sitting high and proud on his chest, defying gravity. And between his legs-</p>
<p>&quot;Non,&quot; he whispered, his breathy accent thick with tears that were beginning to fall. &quot;Non, non, non...&quot;</p>
<p>He looked up at his face in the mirror-beautiful, feminine, completely foreign-and then down at his body again. Breasts, hips, that terrible absence between his legs that was not absence at all but presence of something that should not be there, something that felt and responded and was undeniably real.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyle!&quot; he called out, his voice shaking so badly the words were barely comprehensible. &quot;It is not going away! We are still-everyzing is still-we are still changed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know!&quot; Kyle&#39;s voice came back from across the hall, high and panicked and breaking. &quot;Like, I know! Mine too! Everything is gone and there&#39;s-there&#39;s actually a whole-I can feel inside-&quot;</p>
<p>Neither could finish their sentences. Neither could articulate the full scope of what had been done to them.</p>
<p>They stood in their separate rooms, naked before mirrors that had not existed in their rooms before, staring at bodies that were not theirs, that were nevertheless all they had now.</p>
<p>The apartment&#39;s transformation was slowing now, settling into its new reality like sediment after a flood. Everything that had been Kyle&#39;s and Cole&#39;s was now Kylie&#39;s and Colette&#39;s. Every piece of evidence that two young men named Kyle Nguyen and Cole Russo had ever lived in this space was gone, rewritten, erased as thoroughly as if they had never existed.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to go back to ze shop,&quot; Cole said, forcing the words out through terror and desperation. &quot;Ze sisters-zey did zis. Zey must be able to undo it. Zey must.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Kyle was already moving, grabbing frantically at his transformed closet even though looking at it made him want to scream. &quot;Like, we need to go now!&quot;</p>
<p>His closet was full of pink and white and pastels and things no version of Kyle would ever have chosen. Crop tops and short skirts and cheerleading uniforms and cute sundresses that looked like they belonged to someone much younger and much more vapid than Kyle had ever been.</p>
<p>He grabbed the first things his hands found-a pink cropped tank top and a pair of denim cutoff shorts. The shorts were obscenely short, would barely cover anything, would leave most of his legs exposed. But there was no time to search for something better, no time to make better choices.</p>
<p>He pulled them on with shaking hands, the crop top hugging his breasts in a way that made them impossible to ignore, the shorts riding high on his hips and barely covering his ass. He looked down at himself and wanted to vomit, but there was no time for that either.</p>
<p>Across the hall, Cole was having the same desperate search through a closet that no longer held anything Cole would have worn. Dresses and skirts and fashionable blouses and designer jeans and heels upon heels upon heels. Everything stylish and expensive and sophisticated and completely wrong.</p>
<p>He grabbed a simple red dress because it looked more straightforward than the alternatives, because it seemed like something he could get on quickly without complex fasteners or complicated draping. He pulled it on, the fabric clinging to every curve, emphasizing the body he did not want and could not escape. He grabbed modest black heels from the floor-the lowest ones visible-and slid them on his graceful feet.</p>
<p>They met in the hallway, both dressed in clothes that belonged to people who should not exist.</p>
<p>&quot;My car,&quot; Kyle said, his perky voice barely holding together. &quot;Like, we need to drive there right now.&quot;</p>
<p>They ran out of the apartment, down the stairs that Kyle took two at a time despite his shorter legs, out to the parking lot where-</p>
<p>Kyle&#39;s car was gone.</p>
<p>Where his used Honda Civic had been parked for the past two years, there was now a pink Volkswagen Beetle. Shiny and cute and aggressively feminine, with a small flower in a vase on the dashboard visible through the window.</p>
<p>&quot;Non,&quot; Cole whispered, staring at the car. &quot;Even ze car. Everyzing. Zey changed everyzing.&quot;</p>
<p>But they had no choice, no alternative, no other path forward. Kyle clicked the key fob with shaking hands-it worked, it was his car now according to whatever magic governed reality-and they climbed inside.</p>
<p>The interior smelled like vanilla and the seats had pink covers. There was a cheerleader pom-pom hanging from the rearview mirror, bouncing cheerfully as Kyle started the engine.</p>
<p>He drove in silence, hands gripping the wheel so tightly his knuckles went white. Cole sat beside him equally silent, both too terrified to speak, both hoping desperately that the sisters would be there, would have answers, would be able to fix what they had broken.</p>
<p>The city streets were empty this late, this early, this wrong hour between midnight and dawn. Halloween was over. November had begun. The spell had completed, just as the sisters had promised.</p>
<p>But completion and reversal were not synonyms, as they were beginning to understand too late.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The costume shop appeared before them, and even from blocks away something looked wrong.</p>
<p>The lights were on-they could see that much. The door was hanging slightly open, swaying in the breeze with a creaking sound audible even from the street.</p>
<p>But the windows were filthy. Not merely dirty but covered in grime and cobwebs, as if no one had cleaned them in years. Decades, perhaps. Through the dirty glass they could see the interior, and what they saw made Kyle&#39;s heart sink into his stomach.</p>
<p>Dust. Everywhere. Cobwebs hanging from the ceiling like funeral shrouds. The costume racks still present but skeletal, abandoned, covered in layers of dust so thick they looked like they had been draped in gray fabric.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Kyle whispered, pulling the pink Beetle to the curb. &quot;Like, no, no, no-this can&#39;t be-&quot;</p>
<p>They climbed out and approached slowly, horror growing with each step. The door swung open at Kyle&#39;s push, the hinges screaming with rust and age. The sound echoed in the empty street, in the empty shop, in the empty places where their futures used to be.</p>
<p>The interior was worse than the windows had suggested.</p>
<p>This was not a shop that had closed recently. This was not a shop that had been empty for weeks or even months.</p>
<p>This was a place that had been abandoned for years. For decades.</p>
<p>Dust covered everything in layers so thick that their footprints showed clearly in the gray powder coating the floor. The costume racks stood like skeletal sentinels, cobwebs connecting them in intricate patterns that spoke of long undisturbed time. The air smelled stale and old and dead, the particular scent of places where no living thing had breathed in so long that even the memory of life had faded.</p>
<p>But the lights were on. A single, flickering incandescent bulb hung overhead, casting harsh light over the decay.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Allo?&quot; Cole called out, his breathy accent echoing in the vast emptiness. &quot;Madame Zelda? Zara? Is anyone &#39;ere?&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing answered. Only silence, heavy and complete and utterly without mercy.</p>
<p>They moved deeper into the shop. The deeper they went, the more certain it became that no one had been in this shop for years. The cobwebs were not fresh disturbances but ancient constructions, thick and layered and undisturbed. The dust was not a week&#39;s accumulation but decades of it, compressed and settled.</p>
<p>The counter at the back rose before them like an altar in a dead temple. The old cash register sat there, covered in grime and rust, looking like it belonged in a museum rather than a functioning business.</p>
<p>And there, on the counter, under a layer of dust that would have taken decades to accumulate-</p>
<p>Two student IDs.</p>
<p>It was as if they had been sitting there for years, waiting. As if time had passed differently for these two small pieces of plastic than it had for the shop itself.</p>
<p>As if something impossible had occurred, was occurring, would always occur in this place where normal rules held no power.</p>
<p>Kyle reached for the IDs with a hand that shook so badly he nearly knocked them off the counter. His fingers-small and delicate with those red gel nails-disturbed the dust around the IDs, sending up small clouds that danced in the flickering light.</p>
<p>He picked up the first ID, knowing what he would see, dreading it anyway.</p>
<p>A pretty blonde girl with a high ponytail and pink bow stared back at him from the photo. Big blue eyes. Pale porcelain skin. Heart-shaped face. She was smiling at the camera, looking young and happy and vapid.</p>
<p>The name beneath the photo read: KYLIE WYNN</p>
<p>Major: Sports Marketing</p>
<p>He looked at Cole, who had picked up the second ID with hands that shook just as badly.</p>
<p>An elegant woman with auburn waves and golden skin looked out from the photo. Sultry features. Heavy-lidded eyes. She exuded chic and fashionable.</p>
<p>The name read: COLETTE ROUSSEAU</p>
<p>Major: Fashion Merchandising</p>
<p>They stood in the abandoned shop, holding IDs that proved who they were now, surrounded by decades of dust and decay, and the full weight of what had been done to them finally, truly, completely crashed down upon them.</p>

        <p>Kyle Nguyen was gone. Cole Russo was gone.</p>
<p>Their names had been taken. Their histories had been rewritten. Their very identities had been erased from reality as thoroughly as if they had never existed at all.</p>
<p>The student IDs they had surrendered as collateral-the cards that had borne their real names, their real faces, their real majors and student numbers-those were gone. Erased. Replaced by these new cards that proclaimed new truths about new people.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;re not coming back,&quot; Kyle said quietly, and for once his perky uptalk could not disguise the devastation in the words. &quot;Like, the sisters. They&#39;re not here. They&#39;re never going to be here. They did what they came to do and now they&#39;re gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oui,&quot; Cole agreed, his breathy voice breaking on the word. &quot;Zey did what zey promised. Ze spell is complete. &#39;Alloween is over. Ze transformation is finished.&quot;</p>
<p>Finished. Not reversed. Not undone. Finished. Complete. Permanent.</p>
<p>They had heard what they wanted to hear when the sisters spoke. They had assumed completion meant reversal, that finished meant temporary, that the end of Halloween would restore what had been taken.</p>
<p>They had been wrong about all of it.</p>
<p>The sisters had been very, very careful with their words. They had made promises they kept precisely. They had guaranteed things that came true exactly as stated.</p>
<p>The costumes could be removed-and they had removed them, to no effect.</p>
<p>The spell would complete when Halloween ended-and it had completed, by becoming permanent.</p>
<p>They would get closer to Jessica and Emma-and they had, in ways they never wanted.</p>
<p>Every promise kept. Every word true. Every guarantee fulfilled.</p>
<p>Just not in the ways Kyle and Cole had understood them.</p>
<p>The shop stood silent around them, bearing witness to their realization, offering no comfort and no solutions. The light flickered overhead, casting shadows that seemed to move with purpose, with knowledge, with satisfaction at a job well done.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the depths of the shop, something creaked. Perhaps it was merely the building settling. Or perhaps it was the sound of magic completing its final work, sealing them into these new forms, these new lives, these new identities from which there would be no escape.</p>
<p>The door swung behind them in the breeze, creaking on its ancient hinges. An invitation to leave, perhaps. Or simply acknowledgment that their business here was concluded, that there was nothing more for them to find, no answers waiting in the dust and decay.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Kyle asked, his small voice barely audible.</p>
<p>Cole looked at the ID in his hand-at Colette Rousseau&#39;s elegant face staring back at him, at a name that was now his whether he wanted it or not.</p>
<p>&quot;We go,&quot; he said finally, his accent soft and sad and completely without hope. &quot;We go because zere is nozing else to do. Zere is no one &#39;ere to &#39;elp us. No one to change us back. Zis is what we are now.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood for a moment longer, two beautiful women in an abandoned shop, holding pieces of plastic that proclaimed their new identities, surrounded by the dust of decades and the weight of irreversible choice.</p>
<p>Then, without another word, they turned and walked toward the door.</p>
<p>Behind them, the shop remained as it was-ancient, abandoned, waiting perhaps for the next desperate souls who would find their way to its door on some future Halloween night, seeking simple solutions to simple problems, finding instead transformations they could never have imagined and would never be able to undo.</p>
<p>The lights flickered once as they left, twice, and then went dark.</p>
<p>Kylie Wynn and Colette Rousseau walked out into the November morning, the door swinging shut behind them with a final creaking groan.</p>
<p>Inside, in the darkness, dust settled over the footprints they had left, slowly obscuring even that evidence of their visit.</p>
<p>By the time the sun rose fully, even those traces would be gone.</p>
<p>And Crossroads Costumes would wait, patient and hungry, for Halloween to come around once more.</p>

<p><strong>Author&#39;s Note</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for reading! &quot;Hex Life of College Girls&quot; is my fifth story and a fun break between longer projects-a Halloween special that leans hard into some classic tropes. Halloween transformation stories are practically a rite of passage for TG fiction authors, and I was excited to try my hand at it.</p>
<p>This is the &quot;careful what you wish for&quot; story, the &quot;costumes become permanent&quot; story, the &quot;reality warps around the new identities&quot; story. Tropes are tropes for a reason-they&#39;re fun to play with, and I hope you enjoyed my take on them. After finishing &quot;Yvonne,&quot; leaning into an over-the-top Gothic narrator voice for maximum spooky Twilight Zone atmosphere felt like the perfect way to recharge.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween!</p>
