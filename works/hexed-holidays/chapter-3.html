          Love demands everything. Not politely, not gradually, but with the greedy urgency of something that knows its time is short. Your sanity first, then your identity, finally the very core of who you thought you were. This is the bargain love offers: give me all of you, and I'll give you all in return.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people celebrate Valentine's Day with chocolates and flowers, with reservations at restaurants they can't afford, with small gestures that say "you matter" in the safest possible way. Others celebrate by offering up their very souls. Both are acts of devotion. One is simply more honest about the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie Wynn and Colette Rousseau sat at opposite ends of their apartment's couch on a mid-February evening, close enough to touch but separated by months of careful distance. Two young women who had once been young men. Two people bound together not by friendship or affection but by shared trauma, the kind that either destroys you or binds you together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which it would be remained unanswered. Perhaps it would remain unanswered forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Valentine's Day, which made everything that would unfold both appropriate and cruel. Some nights are meant for declarations, for grand gestures, for choosing someone over yourself. The calendar had marked this night in red ink long before either of them woke that morning thinking the same thought: <em>I don't want to be alone tonight.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Loneliness makes us brave in unexpected ways. Makes us reach for connection even when we've forgotten how, makes us offer small gestures—wine, chocolate, chalky candy hearts—that say <em>you matter to me</em> when we've lost the words to say it aloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          But first, context. Every tragedy needs you to understand what brought the players to this moment. And so much had brought Kylie and Colette here, mere months after Halloween had upended their lives and Christmas had carved away what remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          They'd managed to get rid of the Tree of Knowledge six weeks ago, on Epiphany. January 6th, the day when everyone else on their block had dragged their Christmas trees to the curb for collection. They'd watched from the window as neighbor after neighbor hauled out dried-out pines and spruces, stacking them in sad rows along the street.
        </p>
        <p>
          And since its time had come, their tree had finally allowed itself to be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They'd carried it down the three flights of stairs—still heavy with ornaments, still green and healthy despite being January—and set it with all the others. By morning, the sanitation trucks had taken it away.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the damage had been done. Between the Christmas party at Kylie's parents' house and Epiphany, there had been more knowledge trades. Neither could quite remember them all now. The memories were hazy, fragmented, lost in the fog of those desperate weeks. But they knew there had been more. More moments of need, more knowledge gained, more pieces carved away. They'd both been so altered by the time the tree finally left that they could barely recognize themselves anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it had taken remained gone. The body heals. Skin knits itself whole, bones mend, flesh remembers how to move and breathe and perform all the small rituals of living. But some wounds have nothing to do with the body. Some live deeper, in the space where you used to recognize yourself, in the gap between who you were and what you've become.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cruelest wounds are the ones that leave you intact on the surface while hollowing you out beneath. You wake each morning and the face in the mirror is yours, and yet. The tragedy unfolds slowly, not in a single moment of change, but in the quiet accumulation of erasures. In realizing you've become complicit in your own disappearance. That survival demanded you trade away the very things that made you <em>you</em>, piece by piece, until you can no longer remember what you've lost or why you should mourn it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apartment was quiet now. Through the walls came the muffled sounds of other people's celebrations. Music, laughter, the ordinary happiness of ordinary couples doing ordinary things. From the apartment above, rhythmic thumping and muffled moans, someone's Valentine's Day going very differently than theirs. Here, silence pressed down like fog, broken only by the occasional clink of wine glasses and the rustle of takeout containers being picked at without real hunger.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie had learned what people called her. "BJ queen." "Campus slut." "That cheerleader who'll do anything with anyone." The words had filtered back to her through the gossip networks that ran through the college like blood through veins. Comments overheard in bathrooms, whispered conversations that fell silent when she approached, the particular quality of looks she received in dining halls and lecture halls and anywhere people gathered.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew her reputation. How could she not?
        </p>
        <p>
          The words would have destroyed her once. Maybe they still did, a little. But loneliness carves out such perfect hollows in us. Makes room for something else to grow, something that fills the emptiness even if that something is shame, is need, is the kind of hunger that can't be satisfied but also can't be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Christmas, her hypersexuality had only intensified. The compulsions the tree had given her ran unchecked, untempered, consuming. She went to parties not because she enjoyed them but because she couldn't help herself. When guys looked at her with that particular kind of interest, when they wanted her, needed her, some fundamental part of her brain simply couldn't form the word "no."
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd tried. God, she'd tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sex itself had stopped bothering her, which was somehow worse than if it still hurt. She'd performed oral sex on so many guys at this point that it felt like a skill she possessed, a service she provided, something she was simply good at. The mechanics came naturally now: how to use her tongue, what rhythm to maintain, how to read reactions. Knowledge the tree had granted her, muscle memory that remained even after the tree was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          What killed her was the emptiness after. Walking home alone at 2 AM, the taste of strangers still in her mouth, her jaw aching, her knees bruised. Crawling into bed and staring at the ceiling, knowing she'd do it again. Knowing she couldn't stop herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the worst realization, the one that made her want to scream: she could barely remember why she should want to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a particular species of isolation that exists only in the constant presence of desire. To be wanted—endlessly, insatiably wanted—by bodies that press close in dark rooms, by hands that reach and mouths that take. Perhaps the loneliest place in the world is inside a body everyone wants but no one knows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mind, once sharp enough to grasp game theory and complex economic models, now slipped away from anything requiring sustained abstract thought. Her grades had stabilized at C-minus, barely enough to maintain her cheer scholarship. She'd stopped trying for better. What was the point?
        </p>
        <p>
          The cheer squad was the one place she still felt competent, but even there, the whispers followed her. The other girls were polite to her face, included her in routines, smiled during practice. Then she'd overhear fragments in the locker room: "Can you believe she hooked up with..." "I heard she was with three guys..." "It's honestly just sad at this point."
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd stopped trying to make friends. Stopped accepting invitations. Easier to be alone than to pretend she didn't notice the judgment, the pity, the disgust.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she went to class, went to practice, went to parties where at least people wanted her for something, even if that something made her feel hollow. And she came home to an apartment she shared with the only other person who understood, but who she barely talked to anymore because talking meant acknowledging how bad things had gotten.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Colette had been on eleven first dates in the past six weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a single second one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pattern was always the same. She'd match with someone on the apps. Usually someone who seemed sophisticated on paper. Well-educated, interested in art or culture or fashion. But none of them were quite right. Their understanding of art was superficial. They dressed adequately but without real style. They had never traveled, had no desire to. They were all lacking in small but crucial ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ways they didn't measure up to Antonio, who had been perfect. Sophisticated, charming, exactly what she needed. Who had understood her references, matched her intensity, made her feel seen. And who had vanished after one night, never to respond to her desperate texts again.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she kept trying. Kept lowering her standards. Went on dates with men who weren't quite sophisticated enough, weren't quite cultured enough, weren't quite enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dates would start promisingly. They'd talk about books or film or fashion. But then Colette's filter would fail. She'd criticize their choice of restaurant. Point out that the wine they'd ordered was overrated. Laugh at the mention of some pedestrian television show they'd watched. The opinions would just come out, untempered by tact or kindness, and she'd watch their faces close off.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even if they made it past her judgmental commentary, the obsession would begin. The moment someone showed her genuine interest despite her criticism, something inside her latched on with desperate intensity. By the end of the first date, she'd already be imagining their future together. By the next morning, she'd have texted three times. By that evening, five more messages, each trying to strike the perfect balance between interested and casual and failing completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men always withdrew. Sometimes because she'd been too critical, too harsh, too impossible to please. Sometimes because she'd been too intense, too clingy, too much. Often both.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew she was doing it. Could see herself becoming too much, too desperate. But knowing didn't help. The romantic obsession the tree had given her—the unfiltered, all-consuming need for connection—ran unchecked now, no Cole-like rationality to temper Colette's overwhelming emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          What remained was feeling. Pure, overwhelming, untempered feeling. And loneliness so acute it felt like physical pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd stopped telling people about Antonio. Knew how it sounded. Knew that claiming to love someone after a single evening made her seem unhinged. But the feeling had been real. Was still real, in some ways. Some nights she still thought about him, still checked her messages hoping he'd finally replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emma no longer spoke to her. The friendship had ended that night at the restaurant when Colette had finally, catastrophically, lost her filter. When she'd told Emma exactly what she thought without softening it, without tempering it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she had no friends. No romantic prospects who lasted longer than a single date. No one who understood what she was going through except her roommate, who she barely spoke to anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two people drowning in the same water but too isolated to reach for each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          She spent her evenings alone in her room, watching romantic movies on her laptop, crying at the grand gestures and dramatic declarations, aching for something she couldn't seem to find no matter how desperately she searched.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart knows no cruelty greater than wanting. To ache for something just beyond reach, to carry desire so heavy it bends you beneath its weight? This is how we learn that longing itself can be a kind of breaking.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie found Colette in the kitchen around nine on the Fourteenth of February, both of them moving carefully around each other the way they had for weeks. Polite, distant, two people sharing space but not lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, um," Kylie started, pouring coffee she didn't really want. "You have plans tonight?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Non." Colette didn't look up from her phone. "You?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. I was thinking maybe we could just... hang out? Order food or something?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette finally met her eyes. "Oui. I would like zat."
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither had said what they really meant: <em>I'm so lonely I can't breathe. I'm drowning and you're the only other person who knows what the water tastes like. I need someone who understands.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          So when Kylie had gone out that afternoon, she'd picked up a bottle of wine. Not expensive—she didn't have money for expensive—but nicer than the cheap stuff, something that suggested she cared about making the evening pleasant. And on impulse, a bag of those conversation heart candies, the chalky Valentine's traditions that everyone knows but no one likes. They were terrible, but they were festive and sweet and maybe they'd make Colette smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette had done the same thing, in her own way. She'd stopped at the fancy chocolate shop near campus, the one with truffles in the window that cost three dollars each. She'd bought six of them, carefully selected, arranged in a small white box.
        </p>
        <p>
          An offering. A gesture that said: <em>You matter to me. Even though we barely talk anymore, you matter.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          They'd both arrived home around the same time, each carrying their small gifts, each feeling slightly foolish but also hopeful in a way neither would have admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such small gestures, wine and chocolate and candy hearts. But isn't that how it always starts? The tiniest offerings<em>.</em> Love doesn't announce itself with trumpets and declarations. It begins with someone noticing you're cold and offering their jacket. With someone remembering you like your coffee black. With cheap wine and expensive chocolate on a night when you're both too lonely to pretend otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chinese takeout had been Colette's suggestion. Neutral, easy, something they could pick at while they figured out how to talk to each other again. They'd ordered too much, the way people do when they're nervous, and now most of it sat congealing in containers on the coffee table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie had opened the wine first, pouring two generous glasses. "I got this for tonight," she said, a little shy about it. "Like, I know it's not super fancy? But the guy at the store said it was good. And it's French."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was zoughtful," Colette said, accepting her glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, and I got these too—" Kylie pulled out the conversation candies with a self-conscious laugh. She dumped them into a small bowl on the coffee table, the chalky hearts scattering and settling. "I know they're kind of gross with wine? But it's Valentine's Day and they looked silly and I thought maybe they'd make you smile?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zey are sweet," Colette said, meaning the gesture not the candies. A small smile touched her lips, the first genuine one Kylie had seen in weeks. "I got you somezing as well." She retrieved the white box from her designer bag, opened it to reveal six perfect chocolate truffles. "From zat shop on Main Street."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh my god, Colette, those are so expensive—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is Valentine's Day. We should 'ave somezing nice."
        </p>
        <p>
          They each selected a truffle, bit into expensive chocolate that tasted of cream and vanilla and the kind of craftsmanship you could charge three dollars for.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment they just looked at each other, and something of their old warmth flickered to life. They were still so different, still moving in separate orbits, still coping in incompatible ways. But they'd both tried. They'd both thought about each other, wanted to make this evening less awful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small kindnesses between broken people. Sometimes that's all love is. Remembering someone exists, caring whether they hurt, choosing to show up when it would be easier to stay away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first glass of wine went down quickly, nervously. Conversation came in fits and starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So like, how have your classes been?" Kylie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine. Yours?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine."
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence. Kylie picked up a conversation heart from the bowl, turned it over in her fingers without eating it. BE MINE in faded pink letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ze wine is quite good," Colette offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, it's like, pretty decent for the price?" Kylie set down the candy heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          More silence. This was harder than either of them had expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette refilled both glasses. The wine was helping, loosening something in her chest. "I went on anozzer terrible date zis week."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh yeah?" Kylie took a long drink. "What happened?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "'E talked about 'is job for forty-five minutes. Software engineering. I do not even know what 'e does, just zat it is very boring and 'e is very proud of it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I mean, that does sound pretty boring," Kylie offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And when I tried to change ze subject to books, 'e said 'e does not read fiction because it is a waste of time to read 'made-up stories.' Can you imagine?" Colette caught herself, laughed bitterly. "And zere I go again. Zis is why 'e did not text me back."
        </p>
        <p>
          "At least you're honest?" Kylie offered. The wine was making her feel warm, relaxed. "Like, better than pretending you liked it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Per'aps. But it drives people away." Colette took another drink. "None of zem are right anyway. Zey are all missing somezing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Missing what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not know. Somezing." Colette stared into her wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          They sat with that for a moment. The second glass was going down easier than the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I gave my TA head in the library bathroom on Tuesday," Kylie said suddenly. "Like, during the day. I ran into him in the stacks and he just smiled at me and I followed him to the bathroom and I couldn't stop myself."
        </p>
        <p>
          The confession came without warning, the way they always do when shame has been held too long. When the weight of carrying it alone becomes heavier than the risk of being seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette opened her mouth, closed it. Kylie could see her fighting against the automatic criticism, the harsh judgment that wanted to come out. Finally she managed: "Zat sounds... difficult. And scary."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was." Kylie laughed, but it came out sad. "And I'll probably do it again next week because I can't help myself. Everyone thinks I'm a slut and they're right and I can't stop."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are not a slut," Colette said firmly, then hesitated. "Or if you are, it is not your fault."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks, I think?"
        </p>
        <p>
          They had each nearly finished their second glass of wine. The awkwardness was dissolving, replaced by something rawer, more honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is really sad, isn't it?" Kylie said. "Like, two college girls spending Valentine's Day alone together eating expensive chocolate and getting drunk?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui. It is quite pathetic." But Colette was smiling. "Everyone else is probably out wiz zeir boyfriends or girlfriends. And we are 'ere."
        </p>
        <p>
          "At least we have each other?" Kylie raised her nearly-empty glass. "Like, that's something?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "To 'aving each ozzer," Colette agreed, clinking her glass against Kylie's. "Ze only ozzer person in ze world who knows."
        </p>
        <p>
          They drained their glasses. The wine was warm in their bellies, making everything softer, easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you ever think about it?" Kylie asked after a moment. "Like, what it would be like if we could go back? If Halloween had never happened?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Every day."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too." Kylie stared into her wine. "I think about being Kyle. About how my mind used to work. About being smart and having plans and caring about things." She laughed, bitter. "Now I can barely get through a chapter of my textbook without getting distracted by something shiny."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I zink about being able to... to zink before I speak," Colette said quietly. She gestured vaguely. "Instead I just feel everyzing so intensely and I 'ave no way to step back from it. And zen I say terrible zings to people because I cannot filter my zoughts anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The tree really fucked us up."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui." Colette reached for the wine bottle, found it empty, set it down with a soft clink. "We should 'ave anozzer."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We probably shouldn't," Kylie said, but she was smiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is Valentine's Day. We are sad and alone. We deserve anozzer bottle."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay yeah, you're right."
        </p>
        <p>
          But neither of them moved to get more wine. They just sat there, warm and slightly drunk, the conversation flowing easier now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm so lonely," Kylie whispered. "Like, all the time. I'm surrounded by people and I'm still so lonely."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know," Colette said. "Moi aussi."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Everyone wants me for sex but nobody actually wants me. Nobody knows me. And the person I used to be is just... gone. So I don't even know me anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And everyzing I want, I want too much. Too fast. Too intensely." Colette's voice cracked. "I meet someone and I fall in love immediately and I drive zem away because I cannot control 'ow I feel. And zen I am alone again."
        </p>
        <p>
          They sat in their shared misery, two people who had almost nothing in common except the truth they carried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth that no one else would believe. Truth that isolated them as surely as any prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette reached for the last remaining truffle in the beautiful white box. Bit into it. The chocolate was excellent. Rich, complex, exactly as good as it should be for three dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          But inside, instead of ganache or caramel or any normal truffle filling, there was something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that tasted like roses and cinnamon and starlight. Something that made her teeth ache with sweetness that was too sweet, too intense. She tried to swallow but couldn't. Her mouth felt suddenly, impossibly full, but not with chocolate.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Colette?" Kylie's voice sounded distant. "What's wrong?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette coughed, and smoke poured out of her mouth in a billowing cloud, brilliant pink and shimmering, filling the air above the coffee table. The lights flickered. The temperature dropped. The smoke swirled and coalesced, taking shape, solidifying into a figure that had not been there a moment before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the fuck," Kylie whispered, scrambling backward on the couch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smoke faded, absorbed into the figure like water into sand. What remained was a person sitting cross-legged in the air above their cheap IKEA furniture, suspended as if gravity were merely a suggestion they'd chosen to ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were beautiful in a way that made it hard to look directly at them. Their features shifted between masculine and feminine and something else entirely depending on the angle. Sharp cheekbones becoming soft curves becoming something in between. Their skin had an otherworldly quality, luminous without being pale.
        </p>
        <p>
          They wore clothes that were somehow both timeless and perfectly of the moment: soft pink cashmere that might have been a sweater, white trousers that looked expensive, rose gold jewelry that glinted at their throat and wrists. Everything elegant, understated. Valentine's Day distilled into an aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their eyes, when they opened, were dark and knowing and faintly, infinitely amused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magic always arrives when you're desperate enough to mistake poison for salvation. When your loneliness calls out to the universe like a beacon on exactly the right night. When two broken people sit close enough to touch but separated by everything that's been done to them, wanting connection but having forgotten how to reach for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The universe hears such calls. And on Valentine's Day, it answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure smiled at them both with frank curiosity, ancient eyes taking in two damaged girls on a sagging couch, measuring their despair, their loneliness, their need.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," they said, their voice full of honey and wine and heartbreak. "Happy Valentine's Day."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie and Colette stared, frozen in terror and recognition and the sick certainty that their lives, which had finally begun to stabilize, were about to get worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          "WHAT! THE! FUCK!" Kylie repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure's smile widened, beautiful and terrible and promising nothing good.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hello there, ladies," they said. "I have an offer for you."
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Neither of them moved. Neither of them breathed. They'd learned, through Halloween and Christmas and everything since, that nothing good ever followed words like "I have an offer for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Magic doesn't make house calls to help. It arrives to take, to transform, to extract payment for services you didn't know you were requesting. The girls had paid that price twice already. Their bodies, their minds, their very identities—all currency they'd spent without understanding the exchange rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure seemed unbothered by their terror. They settled more comfortably in the air, one leg crossing over the other, examining both of them with the detached interest of a scientist observing specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can call me anything you like," they continued. "Most people go with 'Cupid' for simplicity. Though I'm not <em>the</em> Cupid, you know. I'm one of many. There are thousands of us, actually. Valentine's Day is our busy season." They gestured vaguely. "Quotas to meet and all that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Quotas," Kylie managed, her voice strangled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can't have Valentine's Day without people falling in love, can we? The whole holiday rather depends on it." The cupid's smile widened. "I've been doing this for three thousand years. You learn to make it interesting."
        </p>
        <p>
          Three thousand years of watching people choose each other, destroy each other, sacrifice each other on the altar of devotion. Three thousand years of knowing exactly how love breaks people and doing it anyway because that's the job, that's the calling, that's what Valentine's Day demands.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you want?" Colette demanded, finding her voice despite her racing heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I already told you. I have an offer." The cupid leaned forward, elbows on their knees. "You're both miserable. Desperately, achingly, beautifully miserable. I can feel it radiating off you. Loneliness, longing, yearning so intense it drew me here like a beacon."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We don't want anything from you," Kylie said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't you?" The cupid tilted their head. "Both of you sitting here on Valentine's Day, wishing you could go back, wishing things were different. That kind of longing on this particular night, that's a summons, whether you meant it to be or not."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We did not want to summon you," Colette insisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Intent isn't required. Just sufficient desperation at the right moment." The cupid waved a hand dismissively. "But we're getting distracted. Let me explain what I'm offering, and then you can decide."
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite every instinct screaming at them to refuse, to demand the cupid leave, to end this before it began, both Kylie and Colette found themselves leaning forward slightly. Listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because desperation makes terrible counsel. Because when you're drowning, you'll grab onto anything that looks like it might float, even if you know—you <em>know</em>—it's pulling you down instead of up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here's your choice," the cupid said softly. "Each of you will decide: stay or betray. Just those two options. Simple, really."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stay or betray?" Kylie repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let me explain." The cupid held up one finger. "You will decide your future tonight. If you both choose 'stay'—to remain as you are now, to stick together—then nothing changes. You stay Kylie and Colette. Female. Damaged. All your memories intact. Exactly as you are in this moment."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would we choose that?" Colette asked quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Excellent question! No one has ever chosen that option in three thousand years, but theoretically, it's available."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid stood, beginning to pace, bare feet almost but not quite touching the floor. Their movements were fluid, hypnotic, inhuman in their grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If one of you chooses to betray while the other chooses to stay, the betrayer wins. Completely. Totally. You—" they pointed at Kylie "—would wake up on November 1st as Kyle Nguyen. Male. Intelligent. Sharp-minded and clear-thinking. Everything you were before Halloween. No memory of being Kylie, no memory of the transformation, no memory of these awful months."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie's breath caught. This was it. What she'd dreamed of since that first terrible morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation offered on a silver platter. Everything restored. Everything undone. Just wake up and it's November 1st and Halloween was a normal party and you're still Kyle, still whole, still yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The person who chose to stay," the cupid continued, turning to Colette, "remains female. But more than that. She will become the betrayer's girlfriend. She'll remember everything. Being your friend, being transformed, watching you forget her entirely. But she won't be able to tell you. Won't be able to explain what was done to her, what she sacrificed for you. She'll simply love you. Perfectly, devotedly, helplessly. For the rest of your lives. Unable to ever reveal the truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          The words fell like stones into dark water.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's evil," Kylie whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is it?" The cupid looked genuinely curious. "She gets to be with someone she cares about. You get to be whole again. Someone gets saved. Just not both of you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And if I betray instead?" Colette asked, her voice barely audible. "If Kylie stays?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Same thing. You wake up as Cole Russo. Kylie becomes your girlfriend, remembers everything, can't tell you, loves you anyway." The cupid smiled. "That's what betrayal means. You save yourself. You doom your friend to silent suffering. One of you gets everything you want. The other gets trapped in a performance that never ends."
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence filled the apartment, heavy and suffocating.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What if we both betray?" Kylie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid's expression brightened. "Ah! Now that's where it gets truly interesting. If you both choose to betray—if you both try to save yourselves—neither changes back. You both stay female. Permanently. No way back, no second chances." They paused for effect. "But mutual betrayal has a cost: you will forget each other completely."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You'll have no memory the other person exists. You'll think Halloween and Christmas happened only to you. You'll be utterly alone with the truth, unable to tell anyone, unable to find comfort in shared experience. And—" The cupid's voice dropped, almost gentle. "—you'll never find true love. Not ever. You'll search for it, long for it desperately, but it will always slip through your fingers. That's the price of mutual betrayal."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the cruelest irony of betrayal: choose yourself and lose the very possibility of being chosen. Mutual selfishness doesn't cancel itself out. It compounds, doubles, becomes a curse that follows you through every relationship that fails, every connection that withers, every moment you reach for love only to watch it slip away like water through your fingers. The punishment for refusing to trust is a lifetime of being unworthy of trust yourself, forever seeking what you destroyed in the moment you chose it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette's hand found Kylie's, gripping tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie looked at Colette. Colette looked at Kylie. The terror in each other's eyes was matched only by the longing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be Kyle again. To be Cole again. To be whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the cost...
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know this is hard. Let me help you understand," the cupid said softly. They raised one hand, fingers poised to snap.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you—" Kylie started.
        </p>
        <p>
          The snap of elegant, impossible fingers echoed through the apartment.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The world inverted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transformation without pain, without transition, without the mercy of gradual change. One moment Kylie, the next moment not. The body reshaping itself in an instant, as if the past months had been nothing more than a dream from which she was finally, blessedly waking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie felt her body shift all at once, like a photograph flipping to its negative. Her chest flattened. Her hips narrowed. Her legs lengthened. Muscle built itself across her shoulders, her arms, her core. Her blonde ponytail shortened and darkened, became Kyle's messy dark hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than the body. Her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fog lifted. Clarity crashed over her like cold water, shocking and perfect and overwhelming. Thoughts that had been slipping away for months suddenly crystallized. Concepts she couldn't hold became graspable again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Holy shit," Kyle breathed, and his voice was his again, deeper, right. "I can think. I can actually think."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside him, Cole had experienced the same transformation of body and mind. "Oh god," he breathed, and even that was strange. His thoughts formed in English first, naturally, instead of arriving in French and requiring translation. His accent was gone, his voice deeper, his own. He looked down at himself—flat chest, broader shoulders, slightly overweight male body—and for the first time since Halloween, everything felt <em>right</em>. "I'm— I forgot what this felt like. Being male again. Having a—" He reached between his legs and laughed, shocked and overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid watched them with obvious delight. "Good, isn't it? Being whole again?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle's mind was racing now, sharp and analytical in ways it hadn't been since October. "This is the prisoner's dilemma," he said, the words flowing easily now. "Classic game theory. Two players, simultaneous decisions, asymmetric payoffs based on coordination failure. The rational choice for each individual—betrayal—produces the worst mutual outcome. But if we cooperate, if we both stay, we—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Very good!" The cupid clapped. "That's exactly right. I can see why you used to love economics."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait," Cole said, his philosophy studies returning to his mind. "Kant's categorical imperative. You should only act in ways you could will everyone to act." He looked at Kyle. "If we both betray, we both lose. So I can't will betrayal as a universal rule. The answer is obvious. We both have to stay."
        </p>
        <p>
          But Kyle was barely listening, his mind churning through probabilities and utilities and decision matrices. "If we assume perfect rationality and self-interest, we should both betray, which means we both lose. But if we can coordinate, if we can trust each other, mutual cooperation yields—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh honey, no, this isn't going to be any fun if you two are that smart," the cupid interrupted, smile widening.
        </p>
        <p>
          They snapped again.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The clarity vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle became Kylie again in an instant. Small, blonde, her mind fogging over like someone had wrapped cotton around her brain. The thoughts she'd been forming scattered, impossible to hold, concepts she'd grasped seconds ago slipping away like water through her fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," she whimpered. "No, please, I was—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole became Colette just as quickly. The ability to examine her own thoughts with any distance, gone. Just overwhelming feeling again, untempered emotion, the desperate ache of wanting without understanding. And all of it flowed through her mind in perfect French.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We could zink again! We were ourselves!" Colette snapped. "And now you put us back in zese bodeez—" She gestured angrily at herself, at the sounds coming out of her mouth. "I do not want zis outrrrrageous accent! I ‘ate eet!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I just wanted to remind you," the cupid said gently, almost kindly. "That's what you could feel like again. That's what I could give you. Complete restoration. Everything you lost, returned in an instant." They settled back in the air, watching them both with those ancient, amused eyes. "Now you understand exactly what you're choosing between."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cruelty dressed as kindness. Showing them heaven just long enough to make hell unbearable. Giving them back themselves for thirty seconds so they'd know exactly what they were sacrificing, exactly what was at stake, exactly what betrayal could win them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some gifts are really weapons. Some mercy is really torture. The cupid had shown them what they could have, and in doing so, made the temptation impossible to resist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie sat on the couch, tears streaming down her face, feeling the difference between what she'd been thirty seconds ago and what she was now. The gap was unbearable. She'd been smart again. She'd been Kyle again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now she was back to this. Back to dim Kylie. Back to thoughts that wouldn't stick. Back to being unable to understand why something was wrong even though she knew it was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You needed to understand what betrayal offers. What you're giving up if you choose to stay." The cupid tilted their head. "I can see you're doubting now. Wondering if you can make this choice at all."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is cruel," Colette whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I see you need some more convincing," the cupid said. "Would you like to see? I could show you. Let you experience it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Show us what?" Colette asked warily, her voice still thick with unshed tears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A vision. Let you experience what would happen." The cupid's smile was knowing. "It might help you decide. Or it might make the choice harder. Either way, it's more interesting than just explaining."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not sure we—" Kylie began. But the cupid had stopped listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Excellent!" They clapped their hands together, delighted. "Let's start with you, shall we?" They pointed at Kylie, their smile beautiful and terrible and promising nothing good.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This," they said softly, "is going to be fun."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid reached out to touch Kylie's forehead with one elegant finger, and the world went dark.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kyle's eyes snapped open to November sunshine streaming through the window of his studio apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment he lay there, disoriented, trying to remember why he felt so relieved. Like he'd woken from a nightmare he could no longer recall.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sat up, stretched, checked his phone. A text from Colette from twenty minutes ago: <em>coffee before class, mon cheri?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled. His girlfriend. Beautiful, sophisticated Colette Rousseau, the French transfer student he'd started dating last month. They'd met at a party—he couldn't quite remember which one—and clicked immediately. She was smart, funny, cultured in ways that made him want to learn more about art and fashion and all the things he'd never paid attention to before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halloween last night had been like a dream. She'd worn a French maid costume to the Sigma Chi party, which he’d found incredibly hot. They'd stayed for a few hours, dancing and drinking, then gone back to her place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfect normal college Halloween.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle got dressed, grabbed his backpack, headed out to meet her for coffee before Econ.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          In the apartment on Valentine's Day, Colette stared at Kylie's unconscious body, slumped haphazardly on the couch at her side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What did you do to her?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid turned to Colette with a cryptic smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You'll see soon enough. We need you to play your role," they said simply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette's eyes widened. "What—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid touched her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink smoke enveloped her, delicate tendrils pulling her into the void.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The contemporary art gallery was all white walls and carefully curated lighting, the kind of space that made you whisper even when you didn't have to. The exhibition was a retrospective of a mid-century abstract expressionist, bold slashes of color and geometric shapes that probably meant something to people who understood these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle stood in front of a large Rothko-inspired piece, hands in the pockets of his well-tailored slacks, tilting his head as if it might help. He checked his watch with a fond smile. Colette was always late. Not because she was disorganized—she was meticulous about everything—but because she took so long getting ready, making sure every element of her outfit was perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gallery doors opened and every eye turned to watch her arrival.
        </p>
        <p>
          God, she was beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette wore a burgundy silk blouse tucked into high-waisted black trousers, the outfit simple but clearly expensive. Her auburn hair was pulled back in a low chignon, a few artful strands framing her face. Gold jewelry glinted in the lighting of the gallery, delicate hoops, a simple necklace. She looked effortlessly elegant, like she'd stepped out of a fashion magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she crossed the threshold, her expression flickered. Confusion, just for a heartbeat, like someone waking up mid-stride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where was she? Some sort of art gallery? How did she get here? Who are all these people?
        </p>
        <p>
          The vision. She was inside the cupid's vision. But where was Kylie? Shouldn't she be here?
        </p>
        <p>
          Scanning the room again, she spotted a familiar face. But not Kylie. Kyle, smiling brightly at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desire swept over her like an ocean's wave. She wanted to be here. Wanted to see him, her boyfriend of a year, her Kyle. The desires arrived fully formed, overwhelming, and for half a second she recognized them as foreign. Not hers, appearing from nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she was moving toward him and the recognition slipped away, leaving only the wanting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle kissed her cheek. "You look amazing. Worth the wait."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course I am," she said, her accent playful. "I 'ad to make sure I looked good enough to stand next to zese paintings. Zey are quite beautiful, non?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was about to say the same thing about you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Flatterer." She smiled, pleased. "Come. Show me what you 'ave been pretending to understand for ze last fifteen minutes."
        </p>
        <p>
          They walked through the gallery together, stopping in front of a canvas of violent red slashes across black.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This one looks angry," Kyle said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Per'aps," Colette said. "Or per'aps it is just... energetic. Passionate. Americans always zink red means anger. In France, red is for love."
        </p>
        <p>
          "In America, red is for stop signs and ketchup."
        </p>
        <p>
          She laughed. "Zis is why you need me. To teach you zat zere are better uses for red."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Like wine?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Exactement! Wine and passion and art. Much better zan ketchup."
        </p>
        <p>
          They moved to the next piece, geometric shapes in muted colors. Kyle studied it seriously. "Okay, I'll bite. What am I supposed to see here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette opened her mouth to answer and felt the explanation already there, waiting, the words lined up perfectly before she'd even thought about what to say. "I see rooms. Boxes. Little compartments where we keep different parts of ourselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's depressingly philosophical for a Saturday afternoon."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You asked." She glanced at him with mock severity. "Next time, just say 'zat looks nice' and we can go get wine."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zat looks nice," Kyle said obediently. "Can we go get wine?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She slapped his arm playfully. "Oui."
        </p>
        <p>
          The performance of normalcy. The theater of relationship. She played her part perfectly because the desires arrived exactly when needed, told her exactly what to want, exactly how to be. Knowledge without origin, feelings without source, all of it designed to create the perfect girlfriend for someone who would never know the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle looked back to the painting. "You know, art is actually interesting when you explain it to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course it is. I am always interesting." She linked her arm through his as they walked. "Zis is why you bring me to zese zings. So I can make you appear sophisticated to your boring economist friends."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My friends aren't boring."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zey are. But zey are your friends and so zey are mine."
        </p>
        <p>
          They finished walking through the exhibition. Kyle took her hand as they headed toward the exit. The autumn afternoon sun was golden through the gallery windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks for coming with me," Kyle said. "You made that actually enjoyable instead of pretentious."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zat is my specialty. Making you look cultured." She squeezed his fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Want to grab dinner? That Indian place you like?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette opened her mouth to say no. She was tired. She wanted to go home, wanted space, wanted to be alone. The "no" was right there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then the desires crashed over her anew.
        </p>
        <p>
          She suddenly wanted to say yes. Wanted to be with him. Wanted to see his face light up. The desire was sudden and overwhelming and warm, filling her chest, pushing out everything else. It wasn't a thought she'd had, it was just there, fully formed, irresistible.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would love zat," she heard herself say.
        </p>
        <p>
          His face lit up exactly like she'd known it would. "Perfect. I'll call for a reservation."
        </p>
        <p>
          And just like that—between one heartbeat and the next—the wanting vanished.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been so strong a second ago. Desperate. Urgent. Now there was nothing. Just the awareness that she'd agreed to dinner when she'd been about to refuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machinery of compulsion laid bare. An endless cycle of manufactured desire designed to keep her performing, keep her perfect, keep her trapped in a role she'd never be able to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kyle—" she started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle looked at her, expectant and happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tried to find the words. <em>Something is wrong. I'm being made to act this way. I don't really love you.</em> But every time she thought about saying them, she saw his face. Saw the confusion. The disappointment. The hurt if she suddenly revealed the truth, pulled away, rejected him after seeming so eager.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't. The thought of causing him pain made her chest tighten. He was so happy. She'd made him happy. How could she take that away?
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's wrong?" Kyle prompted gently.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I... we should leave soon so zey do not give away our table," she said instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good thinking." He put his arm around her shoulders as they walked to the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          She moved with him, fitting against his side. The contact felt right. Natural. Or, it had a moment ago. Now she was just walking, moving through space, while some part of her watched and noticed the pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Want. Act. Want gone. Want something different. Can't, because new want arrives to stop it.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          They reached the car. Kyle opened the door for her with careful courtesy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She slid into the passenger seat. As he walked around to the driver's side, she had a moment alone with the understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was how it would work. How it had been working all night, she realized. She'd wanted to laugh at his jokes, wanted to explain the art, wanted to charm his friends. Each desire arriving exactly when needed, perfectly timed to make her act exactly right.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to be with Kyle. To make him happy. To be his perfect girlfriend. Those wants were always there, always ready, always stronger than anything else. But they weren't hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't tell him. Not because she couldn't speak, the words would come easily enough. But because she couldn't bear to hurt him. That protective instinct sat warm and certain in her chest, just as manufactured as everything else, just as impossible to resist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle got in the car, started the engine, reached over to take her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          She squeezed back, because she wanted to squeeze back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, Colette wanted to vomit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle's smile suspended mid-expression. The street around them became still as a photograph. And pink smoke began to rise from the pavement, swirling around the car, climbing higher, obscuring the frozen scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette sat in the frozen perfect moment and felt the smoke claim her, dissolving everything into pink nothing.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Colette blinked and she was in a bedroom. Their bedroom, she knew somehow. She was bent over the nightstand with something in her hand. A feather duster?
        </p>
        <p>
          She could feel a corset laced tight around her ribs, the short skirt barely covering anything, lace scratching against her skin. She glanced down. Black dress, white trim, her breasts threatening to spill out the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Halloween costume. She was wearing that fucking costume. And underneath the skirt—
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>You have got to be fucking kidding me.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          She heard the front door open. Kyle was home. She suddenly knew it was their anniversary. Two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to look over her shoulder as he pushed open the bedroom door. Still bent over the nightstand, her skirt up, proudly displaying her complete lack of underwear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kyle froze, his jaw slack, mouth searching for words that wouldn't come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire crashed over her. She wanted him to see her like this. Wanted to provoke him, tease him, make him chase her. The wanting filled every part of her, pushed out the horror, pushed out everything until there was just Kyle and this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh!" she said, straightening quickly and letting the skirt fall back into place. Her accent was thick with mock innocence. "Monsieur! I did not 'ear you come 'ome. I was just... cleaning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle just stared dumbly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to face him fully, feather duster still in hand, looking him up and down with deliberate slowness. "'Appy anniversary, monsieur." She paused, then added with a smirk, "I may 'ave been... slacking off a bit. Ze bedroom is not very clean."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Colette—" he started, his voice rough.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui?" She tilted her head, the picture of innocence except for that knowing smile. "Is somezing wrong, monsieur?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He crossed the room toward her and she took a step back, playful. "Are you angry wiz me? I can explain—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're not wearing anything under that," Kyle said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh! Mes pantees!" She glanced down at herself as if just noticing, then back up at him with wide eyes. "I must 'ave forgotten zem! I am such a naughty maid, non?" She bit her lip. "What will you do about it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His hands slid underneath her short skirt to find only bare skin. He groaned. "You did this on purpose."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Per'aps." She pressed against him, feeling how hard he was. "Did it work for monsieur?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know it did."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zen show me." It was a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle pulled her against him and kissed her hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          She kissed back enthusiastically for a moment, then pulled away with a teasing laugh, dancing out of his reach. "Monsieur! I 'ave not finished my work!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Forget the work."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But ze bedroom is such a mess." She gestured with the feather duster. "I could get in trouble."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're already in trouble," Kyle said, and there was something different in his voice now. Not playful anymore. Darker.
        </p>
        <p>
          She backed up until she hit the edge of the bed, looking up at him with that mix of challenge and invitation. "Oh? And what kind of trouble is zat?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The kind where you need to be punished."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something shifted in her chest. The desire changed. Not the teasing want anymore, but something deeper. She wanted to give up control. Wanted him to take it from her. Wanted to submit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Maybe I want to be punished," she heard herself whisper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle's eyes darkened. "Good." He grabbed her wrist, pulled her toward him. "You've been a very bad maid, haven't you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui," she breathed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And bad maids get spanked."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breath caught. She wanted it. Wanted him to punish her, to discipline her, to make her feel it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bend over the bed," Kyle commanded.
        </p>
        <p>
          She obeyed immediately, bending at the waist, her hands braced on the mattress, the short skirt riding up to expose her bare ass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle's hand came down hard on her right cheek and she gasped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Count them," he ordered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Un," she whimpered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another slap, harder, on the left side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Deux—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He spanked her again and again, alternating sides, each strike making her gasp. Her ass burned. She could feel herself getting wetter with each impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cinq—six—sept—"
        </p>
        <p>
          By ten, she was trembling, tears in her eyes, desperately aroused.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Have you learned your lesson?" Kyle asked, his hand resting on her burning skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui, monsieur," she gasped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't think you have." He grabbed her wrists, pulled them behind her back. She felt something soft wrap around them. His necktie. He bound her wrists together, not painfully tight but secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There," he said with satisfaction. "Now you can't tease me anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
          She was helpless now, bent over the bed, hands tied behind her back, ass red from the spanking, completely at his mercy. And she wanted it. Wanted to be helpless for him, wanted to give him this power over her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle's hands slid up her thighs, over her burning ass, then between her legs. "You're so wet," he observed. "You liked that, didn't you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui," she admitted, ashamed of how much.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Say it properly."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I liked it when you spanked me, monsieur," she whispered. "I deserved to be punished."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good girl." His fingers found her clit and she moaned. "Now you're going to take what I give you. No teasing. No games. Understand?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui, monsieur."
        </p>
        <p>
          He positioned himself behind her and entered her in one hard thrust. She cried out. Kyle started to move and she matched his rhythm, meeting each thrust, pushing back against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is zis what you wanted?" she gasped. "Your bad maid screaming for you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "God, yes."
        </p>
        <p>
          She tightened around him. "Zen make me scr—ah!—"
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't tease anymore, couldn't play the game, could only feel him moving inside her while she was bound and helpless. The position, the restraint, the burning of her ass, all of it combined into overwhelming sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          His other hand reached around to find her clit, rubbing in rhythm with his thrusts. "You're going to come like this," he told her. Not a question. A command.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oui—yes—please—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. Beg for it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please let me come," she gasped. "Please, I need—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come for me. Now."
        </p>
        <p>
          She did, the orgasm ripping through her, her body clenching around him. He kept thrusting through her orgasm, chasing his own. When he came, he groaned her name, buried deep inside her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, he carefully untied her wrists, helped her up, turned her to face him. Her ass still burned. Her wrists had red marks from the tie. She looked thoroughly used.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was..." He laughed breathlessly, looking almost embarrassed at his behavior. "You're incredible."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But of course I am," she managed, that teasing note trying to return to her voice. Then, softer, the words she was supposed to say: "I love you so much."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love you too. Happy anniversary, Colette."
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, after dinner and wine and an anniversary gift of a beautiful diamond necklace, Colette lay in bed as Kyle fell asleep with his arm around her, content and happy and completely oblivious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette absentmindedly turned the necklace over in her hands, feeling the weight of his arm, the lingering burn on her ass, the ache in her wrists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd wanted all of that so desperately hours ago. Wanted to be spanked, tied up, dominated. Wanted to submit to him, wanted to give up control. The desire had consumed everything else. And now there was nothing. Just the hollow awareness that it had happened, that she'd performed perfectly, that Kyle was satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire had only been there to make her act. It came, it moved her, and then it left. Like it had never existed. Like it had only been real enough to be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow she'd want him again. And the next day. And the day after that. The wanting would come exactly when it was supposed to, turn her into exactly what he needed, then disappear the moment it wasn't useful anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle suspended in sleep. The room became still. Pink smoke began seeping through the walls, through the windows, filling the space with soft rose-colored fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette felt it wrap around her, obscuring the bedroom, the costume, Kyle's sleeping form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world dissolved into smoke and silence.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Paris. Summer. Colette opened her eyes to see the Seine flowing past in its ancient channel, afternoon sun turning the water to gold. The Eiffel Tower visible in the distance, tourists crowding the banks and bridges, the whole city alive with that particular magic that only Paris in summer possesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          A decade. Somehow she knew. A decade had passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle and Colette had been in Paris for a month already, would stay another two. The apartment—their apartment, because they were rich enough now to own property in Paris—was in the 7th arrondissement, all tall windows and original molding and the kind of elegant Parisian aesthetic that cost a fortune to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle was doing incredibly well. Finance, as it turned out, was perfect for someone with his analytical mind. He'd made senior analyst at twenty-five, managing director at twenty-eight, partner at thirty. Now, at thirty-two, he had the kind of money that let him take three months in Paris while working remotely, that let him own an apartment here to be close to Colette's family.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stood together on one of the Seine's bridges, the ornate iron railing in front of them, the river flowing beneath. It was late afternoon, that golden hour when Paris looked like a painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle had his arm around her waist, both of them taking in the view. He looked good. Successful, confident, perfectly dressed in his expensive suit. He'd achieved everything he'd wanted. Career success. Financial security. A beautiful, sophisticated wife who fit perfectly into his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette stood beside him in a green blazer over a burgundy dress that fell to mid-calf, the fabric flowing elegantly. Her brown leather bag hung from her shoulder. Her auburn hair was styled in a shorter bob, a mature style for a maturing, worldly woman. She looked like she belonged here. Like she'd always belonged on Parisian bridges and in expensive apartments and the kind of life where you summered in the city of your childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
          A decade, or the accumulated weight of one. She hadn't lived each year, each day, each hour. The cupid's vision hadn't made her experience every moment. But she felt them anyway. Felt the erosion, the slow forgetting, as if it had all been real. She possessed the memory of ten years compressed into moments, and the psychological burden was just as heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time as an inexorable weapon. Not the dramatic transformation, not the single catastrophic moment, but the slow accumulation of days and months and years performing a role until you forget there was ever anything else. Until the performance becomes you, or you become the performance, and the distinction no longer matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm glad we came," Kyle was saying, pulling her closer. "Your parents are thrilled to have us for so long."
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to be here with him. The desire sat comfortable and familiar, barely worth noticing anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zey are 'appy to see us," she heard herself agree warmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the truth was she barely remembered her parents anymore. Her real parents, Cole's parents, back in New Jersey, who may or may not even exist in this timeline. These parents, the elegant Parisian couple who owned a gallery in the Marais, who spoke rapid French and kissed her cheeks and called her <em>ma chérie</em>? They were strangers wearing familiar faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memories of being Cole had faded like old photographs, details becoming fuzzy, emotions becoming distant. She remembered that she had been someone else once. Remembered being transformed. But Cole himself? That person's thoughts and dreams and the life he might have lived? Mostly gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          What remained was this. Colette Rousseau, born in Lyon, raised in Paris, moved to America for college, married to Kyle Nguyen. A woman who loved art and fashion, who was charming and witty and elegant, who performed her role so perfectly that even she sometimes forgot it was a role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except in moments like this, standing on a bridge overlooking the Seine with a man who loved someone who didn't really exist, when she remembered enough to feel the weight of what had been lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle was talking about his work, some deal he was putting together, the excitement of the challenge. He was happy. He'd achieved his dreams. He had no idea that his happiness was built on her silent suffering, that every perfect moment of their life together was sustained by her inability to tell him the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked down at the water flowing beneath the bridge. For a fleeting moment, she wondered what it would be like to choose an ending. Her own ending. It would be so simple to step off the bridge and let the Seine take her.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she couldn't. Kyle's perfect wife would never do such a thing. The same compulsion that made her explain paintings and wear costumes and smile on cue wouldn't allow even this escape, because of how it would hurt Kyle. She had to keep living.
        </p>
        <p>
          For him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cruelest prison is the one that looks like paradise. The one everyone envies. The one where your captor loves you and has no idea you're suffering. Where escape means hurting someone who's done nothing wrong, who never asked for you to sacrifice yourself, who would be horrified to know the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're quiet," Kyle observed, turning to look at her. "Everything okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just enjoying ze view," she heard herself say with a soft smile, gesturing at the Seine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the right answer. The perfect answer. Kyle relaxed, smiled back, pulled her closer against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's beautiful here," he said. "We should come back every summer."
        </p>
        <p>
          She heard herself agree. "Oui. Every summer."
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire had become so natural she almost forgot it wasn't hers. Almost forgot there had ever been a time when she'd questioned these desires, fought against them, recognized them as foreign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now they just were. She wanted to be with Kyle. Wanted to make him happy. Wanted to be his perfect wife. The wants arrived so smoothly, so consistently, that they felt like truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes—in quiet moments, in the spaces between compulsions—she wondered if Cole had ever really existed at all. If that person she dimly remembered being wasn't just a dream she'd had once, a story she'd told herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe she had always been Colette. Maybe there had never been anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought should have terrified her. Instead, it just felt inevitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyle was watching her with affection, this man who loved her, who had no idea what their love cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love you," he said simply.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love you too," she heard herself reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          And maybe, in some terrible way, it was even true.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world froze. Kyle's expression suspended mid-smile. The river below became still. The summer afternoon became still as a painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink smoke rose from the Seine's surface, swirled around the bridge, climbed higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette stood on the frozen bridge overlooking her perfect Paris afternoon and felt the smoke claim her.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie and Colette bolted upright on their couch, both gasping as they were pulled back from the vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ohmygod," Kylie blurted out, as if she'd been holding her breath through the entire vision. "Oh. My. God. That was amazing. Like, I could think again! Everything was right! And I was so successful? And everything was so perfect and we were so happy?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to Colette, eyes shining. "You should have seen how good our life was! How perfect everything was! I could be Kyle again! We could have all of that!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette sat frozen, her elegant face sheet-white, tears streaming down her cheeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Colette?" Kylie's enthusiasm faltered. "What's wrong?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was zere," Colette whispered, her voice breaking. "I was 'er. In the vision. I felt everyzing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So you know! It was so perfect? Like, you were so sophisticated and happy?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was not ‘appy! I was screaming inside!" Colette's hands were shaking. "Eet is 'ard to explain! I wanted everyzing, but it was not what I wanted. I had desires zat were not me. Wanted you—wanted 'im."
        </p>
        <p>
          She made a choked sound. "God, ze sex—"
        </p>
        <p>
          They both went very still.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sex. They'd had sex. With each other. In the vision. Intimate, explicit sex where Colette had been—
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie's face flushed deep red. "I didn't mean to—I mean, in the vision I didn't know it was—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know." Colette looked away, her own face burning. She couldn't look at Kylie. Couldn't face her after what Kyle had put her through. The spanking. The begging. Being tied up and helpless. "I know it was not really you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm so sorry—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Non, do not—" Colette's voice cracked. "Zat is not—zat is not ze worst part."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's the worst part?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wanted it." Colette's hands twisted together. "All of it. In ze moment, I wanted everyzing. Wanted to please you—'im. Wanted to be punished. Wanted to submit. Ze desires were so strong zey felt real. And zen ze moment it was over, zey were gone. Just... gone. Like zey 'ad never existed."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," Kylie said quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at Kylie with devastated eyes. "You saw perfect girlfriend. I felt myself disappear. Every day wanting exactly what I was supposed to want until I could not remember what I 'ad wanted before. Until I almost believed ze desires were real."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't know," Kylie whispered. "I couldn't tell. You seemed so happy. The whole time, I thought—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please," Colette whispered. "Please do not do zat to me. You felt what it is like to be whole again. I felt what it is like to be erased. Please."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie fidgeted with a strand of her hair. "I… won't," she said, but her voice wavered. "I won't do that to you. I promise."
        </p>
        <p>
          The words sounded hollow even to Kylie’s own ears. Because she'd felt it, those precious moments of being Kyle again, of thinking clearly, of being whole. The temptation was still there, singing in her blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette heard the uncertainty too. A stricken expression passed over her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We are done 'ere," Colette said, turning to the cupid with as much firmness as she could muster. "Neizzer of us will betray ze ozzer. You should leave."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid's smile widened, ancient and knowing. "Oh, not so fast. You might feel differently after you see what's in store for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Non—" Colette started.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid's finger extended toward Colette's forehead. "Your turn."
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Cole woke in his dorm room to the smell of coffee from the pot he'd set to brew the night before.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stretched, stared at the ceiling, and thought about last night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Halloween party. He'd been standing in the Sigma Chi house near the drinks table, making some stupid joke about how half the costumes there were just "attractive person in revealing version of a profession," when he'd heard someone laugh behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie Wynn. Adorable, enthusiastic Kylie Wynn. A cheerleader who was completely out of his league. Standing there in her cheer uniform. Which, okay, was exactly the kind of lazy costume he'd just been mocking. Just wearing your actual uniform to a Halloween party? But she'd looked incredible, so maybe that was the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're not wrong," she'd said, grinning at him. "I literally grabbed this from my locker like an hour ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then she'd just... stayed. Talked to him. Laughed at his jokes. Danced with him even though he was terrible at dancing. Stood close, touched his arm when she laughed, looked at him like he was interesting instead of just some nerdy philosophy major.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given him her number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole grabbed his phone and opened his contacts. There it was: Kylie Wynn, with a little cheerleader emoji she'd added herself when she'd typed in her number. He hadn’t dreamed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Text me tomorrow?" she'd said, with this smile that made him forget how to form words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Girls like Kylie didn't notice guys like Cole. But somehow last night she'd seemed genuinely interested. Maybe she'd been tired of drunk guys hitting on her all night and appreciated someone who could actually make her laugh?
        </p>
        <p>
          He should text her. Right? That's what you did when a beautiful cheerleader gave you her number and explicitly told you to text.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what would he even say? "Hey, did you mean it?" Too desperate. "Want to hang out?" Too casual. "I can't stop thinking about you?" Way too intense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole got up, poured coffee, opened his philosophy textbook. He'd text her later. Kant wasn't going to read himself.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          In their apartment, Colette lay slumped unconscious on the couch next to Kylie.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now what happens?" Kylie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid looked at her with interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You get to see the other side," they said as they touched her forehead and pink smoke enveloped her.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The campus gym. Late afternoon. Cole had just finished his workout: thirty minutes on the treadmill, heavy weights, pushing himself. He'd started coming regularly six months ago when he and Kylie got together, motivated by her incredible athletic body. If he was going to be with someone who looked like that, he needed to at least try to measure up.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was working. He'd lost twenty pounds, put on real muscle. His arms had definition now, his chest and shoulders were broader, his core was tight. Not cheerleader-level athletic, but he looked good. Felt like maybe he deserved to stand next to her without people wondering what she was doing with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He grabbed his towel, wiped his face, headed toward the locker room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group fitness studio door opened and Kylie walked out with some other cheerleaders, all of them in practice gear. She stopped just outside the door, looking around like she'd forgotten something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where was she? The gym. Weight racks, treadmills, mirrors everywhere. She looked down at herself. Sports bra, tiny athletic shorts, her body flushed and sweaty from practice. Cheer practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vision. This had to be the cupid's vision. Where was Colette? Was she here?
        </p>
        <p>
          She scanned the gym and spotted someone looking at her from across the room. A guy heading toward the locker room. It was Cole, but… muscular? Way more muscular than she remembered Cole being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desire hit like a tidal wave. She needed him. Needed him NOW. It crashed through her with physical force, heat flooding her body, arousal instant and overwhelming. Not scattered want for attention, not vague need for validation. Just Cole. Just this. Just him touching her right now or she'd go insane.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>No. Not here. Not at the gym. Please not here.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cole!" She left her teammates behind, walking quickly toward him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Cole said, smiling. "Good practice?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She barely heard him. Her eyes were locked on his body, sweaty from the gym, his t-shirt clinging to the muscle he'd built, and god she needed her hands on him. Needed his hands on her. Needed him inside her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come with me," she said, her voice urgent. She grabbed his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think I pulled something at practice. Can you look at it?" She was already pulling him, not waiting for questions, heading past the weight racks toward the hallway.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie, where are we—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Physical therapy room." She found the door, pulled it open, dragged him inside. Small room. Padded treatment table. Mirrors. Door with a lock.
        </p>
        <p>
          She locked it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you okay?" Cole asked, concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of answering, she turned and kissed him hard. Desperate. Her hands already pulling at his shirt, yanking it up and over his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie, we’re at the gym, I don’t think—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don’t care." Her voice was raw. "I need you right now. I need you so bad."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Someone could need this room. Someone could hear—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't care!" She was already pulling her sports bra over her head, tossing it aside. Her hands went to her shorts, shoving them down along with her underwear in one motion. Completely naked now in the clinical PT room while he was still dressed, still hesitating.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pressed against him, skin to skin, grabbed his hand and pushed it down between her legs. "Feel how much I need you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole groaned when he felt how wet she already was. "Jesus Kylie—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please." She was working at his gym shorts now, pulling them down. "Please, I'll do anything. Whatever you want. Just please—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie, this is—" But he was getting hard, his body responding even as he tried to protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want to taste you first," she said suddenly, desperately, dropping to her knees on the hard floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What? No, you don't have to—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I <em>need</em> to." She freed him from his shorts, took him in her mouth without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh god—" Cole's hands went to her hair, not pushing, just holding on.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could see herself in the mirrors. Naked on her knees in a gym PT room, mouth full of him, desperate and hungry and debasing herself because the need was too strong to resist. She should have felt ashamed. Should have cared. But all she felt was the compulsion driving her forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          She worked him with her tongue, her lips, taking him deeper, making obscene sounds that echoed in the small room. She wanted him hard, wanted him so desperate he'd forget they were in public, forget all his nice-guy hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie, stop, you're going to make me—"
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled off with a wet sound. "Not yet. I need you inside me first." She stood, turned to the treatment table, bent over it. Legs spreading. Looking back at him over her shoulder. "Please. Like this."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole just stared, his cock hard and wet from her mouth, clearly torn between desire and the wrongness of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please," she begged, and hated how desperate she sounded but couldn't stop. "I need it. I need you. Please—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The crude plea seemed to break something in him. He stepped forward, his hands gripping her waist, and suddenly lifted her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gasped as he pressed her back against the wall, her legs wrapping around him instinctively. He was strong enough now to hold her there, suspended, her back against the cool concrete.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes," she breathed as he positioned himself and entered her. "God, yes—"
        </p>
        <p>
          He started to move and she clung to him, arms around his neck, legs locked around his waist. In the mirrors she could see everything, her body pinned against the wall, his muscles straining to hold her, her face twisted in desperate pleasure. She looked wanton. Shameless.
        </p>
        <p>
          She should care. Should feel degraded. But the need was too overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Harder," she gasped. "More. I need—god, I need—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole gripped her hips and thrust harder, faster. The sound of her back hitting the wall with each thrust echoed in the small room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You feel so good," Cole groaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't stop," she panted. "Don't stop, don't stop—"
        </p>
        <p>
          She came hard, crying out loud enough that anyone in the hallway would hear. She didn't care. Couldn't care. The orgasm crashed through her but it wasn't enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Keep going," she begged as soon as she could speak. "Please, I need more—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole kept thrusting, clearly close himself now. "God, Kylie—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come inside me," she panted. "Please, I want to feel it—"
        </p>
        <p>
          That pushed him over. He came with a groan, buried deep inside her. She came again, the physical response automatic and intense.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment they both just breathed hard. Then Cole pulled out and Kylie climbed down, her feet touching the cool floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could feel him dripping out of her. Could see herself in the mirrors. Sweaty, naked, thoroughly fucked, hair a mess. Looking like exactly what she was: a girl who'd just begged to be taken in a semi-public room because she couldn't control herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          They dressed quickly, both suddenly aware of where they were. Cole kept glancing at the door nervously.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they walked out of the gym together, Cole's arm around her shoulders, the desire drained away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just gone. Like someone had flipped a switch. Five minutes ago she'd been on her knees, begging, degrading herself because the need was too overwhelming. Now there was nothing. Just the hollow awareness of what had happened, what she'd done.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd needed him. Needed sex with him specifically, needed to make him want her, needed that connection and intensity and satisfaction. The desire had been real and overwhelming and all-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now it was gone like it had never existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow she'd need him again. And again. Probably multiple times a day. The hypersexuality wasn't gone, it was just channeled, focused, weaponized to make her the perfect sexually available girlfriend who could never say no, never needed space, never wanted anything except him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole suspended mid-stride. The afternoon light became still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink smoke seeped up from the sidewalk, wrapped around Kylie's athletic form, obscured everything.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie blinked and she was sitting in a lecture hall. Old building, wood paneling, tall windows. Afternoon sun slanted through, dust motes dancing in the light. She was in the third row, wearing a sundress, her hair loose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole stood at the front. Older. Not a lot, but she could tell. Dressed professionally. Talking to a panel of professors. A presentation board behind him: "Moral Responsibility in the Absence of Free Will: A Neo-Kantian Approach."
        </p>
        <p>
          His dissertation defense. Three years. She knew somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie wanted to be here. Wanted to support him. The desire sat warm and certain in her chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she understood nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words washed over her. Free will, moral responsibility, deontological frameworks. Sentences too long, concepts too abstract. After fifteen minutes, she'd stopped trying to follow and just smiled whenever Cole looked her way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love as silent witness to accomplishments you can't comprehend. Supporting dreams you can't understand. Being present in a life that's moved beyond you while pretending you're keeping pace. The slow realization that you've become decoration in someone else's achievement, valuable for being there but not for anything you contribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the professors asked a challenging question. Cole responded with something complex. The committee members nodded approvingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie felt pride rise automatically. She was proud of him even though she had no idea what he'd accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          His defense concluded, Cole looked nervous but optimistic as he walked back to join her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You were amazing!" she heard herself say, hugging him tight. "Like, you totally killed it!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks," Cole said, squeezing her. "I'm glad you were here."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course! I wouldn't miss this!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She meant it. Had canceled on her girlfriends who had invited her for happy hour, spent an hour getting ready, sat through ninety minutes of incomprehensible philosophy. Because being here mattered to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The committee called him back. Five minutes later, Cole emerged beaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dr. Russo," he said, testing the title.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh my god!" Kylie threw her arms around him, genuinely happy. "I'm so proud of you!"
        </p>
        <p>
          They went to the department celebration afterward, a reception in the faculty lounge with wine and cheese and congratulations. Cole's advisor, his committee members, other graduate students, faculty Kylie supposed she had met at various events over the past three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone liked her. She was fun, enthusiastic, easy to talk to. Cole's advisor always greeted her warmly. The other grad students joked with her. Faculty spouses made small talk about campus events.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nobody really talked to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          They talked around her. Near her. Past her.
        </p>
        <p>
          A group discussion about departmental politics. She smiled and nodded, contributing nothing. Someone mentioned a controversial paper. She had no idea what they were referencing. Cole's advisor made a joke about Wittgenstein that everyone laughed at. She laughed too, a beat late, not getting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The invisible woman at the academic gathering. Present but not participating. Smiling but not comprehending. Loved but not seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie excused herself after twenty minutes, looking for the bathroom. The faculty lounge only had one and someone was using it, so she headed down the hall toward the department bathrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hallway was quiet, out of the way. Old building, dim lighting, nobody around.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was almost to the bathroom when she heard footsteps behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie."
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole's advisor. Professor Brennan. Distinguished, silver-haired, the man Cole looked up to more than anyone. The person who would write his recommendation letters, help him get a postdoc, control his entire career trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, hi Professor Brennan!" She turned with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wanted to catch you alone for a moment." He stepped closer. "To tell you how proud I am of Cole. He's accomplished something really special."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know! I'm so proud of him too."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You've been very supportive. That matters more than you might think." Another step closer. "A good partner is essential for an academic career."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm happy to support him." She started to turn toward the bathroom. "I should—"
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand caught her arm. "You're a very beautiful woman, Kylie."
        </p>
        <p>
          She froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cole is a lucky man." His hand slid down from her arm to her waist.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to pull away. Wanted to scream "don't touch me." Wanted to shove him off and walk away.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the thought of doing that made her chest tighten with panic. He was Cole's advisor. Cole's mentor. The person who controlled Cole's entire future. Making a scene would humiliate Cole. Would ruin his relationship with the one person who could make or break his career.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't do that to him. Couldn't hurt him like that. The desire to protect him was overwhelming, stronger than her own disgust, stronger than her fury, stronger than her desperate need to get away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, but I really should—" she tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stepped closer, backing her against the wall. His other hand joined the first at her waist. She tried to push him away. Her hands wouldn't move. <em>Can't offend him. Can't upset him. Cole needs him.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Professor Brennan, I don't—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shh." His hand slid down to her hip, then around to her ass, squeezing. "You don't need to be nervous."
        </p>
        <p>
          She wasn't nervous. She was terrified. And furious. And screaming inside to move, to shove him, to knee him in the balls, to run back to the party and tell everyone what he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But instead she stood there. Frozen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such a pretty little thing," Brennan murmured, his hand sliding up under her sundress, over her bare thigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Move. Move. MOVE.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Professor Brennan—" she tried again, but her voice came out small, not the shout she wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand reached the edge of her underwear.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tried to step sideways, to twist away. Her body wouldn't respond. The desire to do everything for Cole held her in place. <em>Cole needs this man. Cole's entire future depends on this man.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          So she stood there while his fingers slid beneath the fabric.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the distance, she heard laughter from the party. Cole's voice, happy and bright.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brennan's hand stopped, his fingers still touching her. The hallway became still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink smoke seeped through the walls, gentle and inevitable, obscuring the frozen violation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And like a prayer being answered, everything dissolved.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie blinked and she was sitting on a couch. Cream-colored, modern, expensive. Large windows, afternoon light, plants everywhere. A beautiful house.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked down and almost screamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her belly was enormous. Stretched tight over something moving inside her. She touched it with both hands, feeling the hard curve, and the baby kicked back against her palm, a strong, insistent push from inside her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven months pregnant. She knew somehow. Her third child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything felt wrong. Her body was heavy in ways she couldn't have imagined. Her breasts were swollen and tender, her back ached, her feet felt puffy and tight. Not that she could see past her belly to her own feet anyway. When she shifted on the couch, the movement was awkward, ungainly. She had to use her arms to lever herself because her core muscles were useless under the weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The baby moved again, a rolling sensation like something sliding around inside her, pressing against her ribs, making it hard to breathe deeply. She felt it press down low, against her bladder, and knew she'd need to pee again soon even though she'd just gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a whole person growing inside her, moving on its own, taking up space, pressing on everything, and she had no memory of choosing this, of wanting this, of—
        </p>
        <p>
          She heard the front door. "I'm home!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole. Older—early thirties now. Tenure. Associate professor. The successful academic coming home to his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emma was leaning against her side, showing her a drawing. Four years old, floral dress, chattering about something. And Michael—two years old—sat on the floor with his blocks and toy cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The perfect scene. Mother and children waiting for daddy to come home.

        <p>
          Suddenly, the revulsion over her pregnancy was simply gone. She wanted to be here. Wanted to be a good mother. Wanted to make Cole's life easier. The desires sat warm and steady in her chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole walked into the living room and stopped, a smile spreading across his face at the scene before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfect tableau. Mother and children, peaceful and content, bathed in golden afternoon light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five years of marriage. Two kids with a third on the way. Kylie’s entire existence had narrowed to this: wife, mother, the person who managed the household while Cole pursued his career.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd done personal training after college, taught some barre classes at a studio. Nothing serious, but it was something. When Emma was born, she'd quit. It just made sense. Cole's career was important, required long hours and focus. Someone needed to be home with the kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she was home. Always home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beautiful modern house felt like the only world that existed. Every carefully chosen piece of furniture, every plant, every decorative object, all part of the perfect life she wanted to maintain for her family.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the slow disappearance. Not dramatic, not violent, just the gradual narrowing of a world until it fits inside four walls. Until your identity consists entirely of roles you play for other people. Until you can't remember what you wanted before you wanted what you were supposed to want.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is nice," Cole said, crossing to kiss her forehead. "Peaceful afternoon?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The kids have been good," she heard herself say with a warm smile. "We've been having fun, haven't we?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Emma nodded enthusiastically. Michael looked up from his blocks long enough to shriek "Daddy!" before returning to his construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole sat on the arm of the couch, his hand resting on Kylie's shoulder. "You look beautiful today."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you," she heard herself say, pleasure warming her voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to please him. Wanted to be the wife he came home to. Wanted this peaceful beautiful scene to be real.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew she'd been sitting here for hours, playing with the kids, reading books, helping Emma color, watching Michael stack blocks. The same things she did every day. Every single day. While her body grew heavier with the third child, while her world stayed small and domestic, while her identity disappeared completely into this role.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd forgotten what else there was. Forgotten what Kyle had wanted beyond this. Sometimes she wondered if there had ever been anything else at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was just this now. Just Kylie. Just Mom. Just the wife who made Cole's work possible by handling everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          The baby kicked hard against her ribs. She touched her belly, the maternal gesture automatic.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Only two more months," Cole said. "Are you nervous?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A little," she heard herself admit. "But excited too."
        </p>
        <p>
          Two more months of pregnancy. Then sleepless newborn months. Then years more of this, the endless cycle of childcare and domestic management while Cole pursued his career and she stayed home with their children.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted it. Wanted to be a good mother. Wanted to support his career. Wanted this life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But underneath the desire, buried so deep she could barely feel it anymore, was the awareness that she'd disappeared. That Kyle was gone. That the person she'd been had been completely erased and replaced with this, with Mom, with Wife, with the beautiful supportive partner in the perfect house with the perfect family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow she would do this again. And the next day. And the next. For twenty more years. Thirty. Until the kids were grown and gone and she was just the aging wife of a philosophy professor, her entire life having been consumed by this role she couldn't remember choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole kissed her, tender and affectionate. "I love you. You're amazing, you know that? Everything you do for this family."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love you too," she heard herself say softly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to say it. The desire was warm and real in her chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole suspended mid-kiss. Emma's drawing held motionless. Michael's blocks frozen mid-stack. The afternoon light became still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink smoke seeped through the large windows, gentle and inevitable, filling the beautiful modern living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie sat on the cream couch in her pink dress, one hand on her pregnant belly, surrounded by her frozen perfect family, and felt the smoke claim her, dissolving the house and the husband and the children and the future that would consume her entirely.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Colette and Kylie both gasped as they were pulled back to Valentine's Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mon dieu," Colette breathed, her accent thick with emotion. "I know it was not real. But it felt so real. I had a career—I was successful, I 'ad tenure, I 'ad published." She turned to Kylie with shining eyes. "You saw it too. Saw our family—"
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie sat frozen, her expression pure horror. The hallway. Brennan's hands on her. Unable to move, unable to speak, unable to protect herself because it would hurt Cole.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kylie?" Colette's voice faltered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I couldn't stop him," Kylie whispered. "He was touching me and I couldn't—I tried to push him away but I couldn't hurt Cole's career. I just stood there and let him—"
        </p>
        <p>
          She wrapped her arms around herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette went very still. "What 'appened?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cole's advisor. Brennan. In the hallway after the dissertation thing. He cornered me. Touched me. I wanted to scream, wanted to run, but the compulsion wouldn't let me protect myself if it meant hurting you—him—" Her voice broke. "Please, you can't do that to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did not know," Colette whispered. "I am so sorry."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Please," Kylie whispered. "Don’t make me live that life. Please."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid watched them both with those ancient, knowing eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," they said softly. "Now you both know. Now you both understand exactly what betrayal brings. And what it costs."
        </p>
        <p>
          Salvation has a price, and the price is often paid by someone else. What if being saved means condemning your friend to silent suffering? To a life that looks perfect from every angle, that photographs beautifully, that everyone envies? But while inside she dies by degrees, slowly, quietly, where no one can see? Is that a price any of us can ask another to pay?
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid watched them both with infinite patience, as if they had all the time in the world. Perhaps they did.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So," the cupid said softly. "Now you understand. Both of you have felt what it's like to be whole again. Both of you have experienced what you will suffer if the other chooses betrayal. The question is: what will you choose?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence stretched between them, both lost in the same calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie's mind kept circling back to those moments of clarity when she'd been Kyle again. Sharp, analytical, successful. She could have that back. Could wake up November 1st with no memory of these terrible months. All she had to do was betray Colette.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at her roommate. Elegant even in distress, mascara smudged from crying. Her roommate. Her only friend who understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could she do that to her?
        </p>
        <p>
          Across from her, Colette was running the same equation. The rationality she'd lost, the ability to think instead of just feel. She could be Cole again, male, accomplished, whole. Everything she'd glimpsed in the vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at Kylie, small and blonde and damaged. The only other person in the world who knew the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could she condemn her to that fate?
        </p>
        <p>
          But the temptation. God, the temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And worse. The fear. What if the other person was thinking the same thing? What if trust was just another word for being the fool who stayed while the other saved herself?
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence stretched on.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you thinking?" Kylie whispered finally.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zat I want to be Cole again," Colette admitted. "More zan anyzing."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too. I want to be Kyle so bad."
        </p>
        <p>
          More silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But I will not do zat to you," Colette said quietly. "Ze desires that are not yours, that appear just to make you act right, not being able to tell anyone—it was 'orrible."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Kylie said. "I can't do that to you either."
        </p>
        <p>
          They looked at each other, both thinking the same thing: <em>But what if you betray me anyway?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because that was the real core of the prisoner's dilemma. Even if they both wanted to cooperate, even if they both cared about each other, the reasonable thing to do was betray. Beyond the temptation of becoming yourself again lay the horror of knowing you could be trapped forever if the other person betrayed you. The only way to protect yourself against betrayal was to also betray.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the only way mutual cooperation worked was trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how could they trust each other when they both wanted the same thing so desperately?
        </p>
        <p>
          Trust is the most dangerous thing you can offer someone. More dangerous than hate, more dangerous than love itself. Because trust means giving someone the power to destroy you and choosing to believe they won't use it. It means being vulnerable when every instinct screams for self-preservation. It means risking everything on the hope that someone else will value you more than they value themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you trust me?" Kylie asked, her voice small.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want to," Colette said honestly. "But I am so scared."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid stood, stretching languidly. "I hate to rush you, but we do need to resolve this. It's nearly midnight and I have other appointments." They walked to the coffee table, picked up the small bowl of conversation hearts. "Let's make this interesting."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid tipped the bowl, and the candy hearts tumbled onto the coffee table. As they fell, the words on them changed. Every single heart now read either STAY or BETRAY in faded pastel letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid's elegant fingers sorted through them, selecting four hearts. Two pale pink STAY hearts. Two light blue BETRAY hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Each of you gets both options," the cupid explained. They handed Kylie one STAY and one BETRAY. Did the same for Colette. "Turn your backs to each other. Choose one. Hold it in your closed fist."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait—" Kylie started.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No more discussing it. No negotiating. Just choose." The cupid's voice was firm. "Turn around."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie and Colette turned their backs to each other on the couch, each holding two candy hearts. One offering salvation, one offering sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apartment was silent except for their breathing.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Kylie stared at the two hearts in her palms. Pink STAY in her left hand. Blue BETRAY in her right.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd already run through all the logic her clouded mind could handle. Already felt the temptation of being Kyle again, already witnessed the horror of what betrayal would do to Colette. Already imagined every outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, holding the actual choice, logic felt distant and useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn't a thought experiment anymore. This was real. In a few seconds, she'd close her fist around one of these hearts and that would be it. No taking it back. No changing her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind her, she could hear Colette's breathing, quick, shallow, terrified.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if Colette betrayed her? The thought slithered in unbidden. What if right now, behind her back, Colette was choosing BETRAY? Choosing to be Cole again, choosing to trap Kylie in silent suffering?
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be logical. Self-preservation. The smart move, really.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some choices can't be made with logic. Some decisions require a different kind of courage, the courage to be foolish, to trust when reason says don't, to choose vulnerability when self-preservation screams for betrayal. Sometimes the only way forward is to close your eyes and leap, hoping someone will catch you.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at the two hearts again, her hands trembling.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Behind her, Colette held her own choice. STAY. BETRAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't think through this like Cole would have, analyzing the moral imperatives and ethical implications. All she had was feeling. And the feeling was terror.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not just of being betrayed. Though that was there, the sick certainty that Kylie might choose BETRAY, might choose to be Kyle again and trap Colette in the prison she'd just witnessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worse than that: the terror of her own temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because she wanted it. Wanted to be Cole so desperately it hurt. Wanted the successful career, the intellectual respect, the devoted wife.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BETRAY heart sat in her right palm. So small. So easy. Just close her fist around it and all of this would end. She'd wake up as Cole Russo with no memory of these terrible months.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Kylie would suffer. Forever. Silently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The romantic movies she'd been watching flashed through her mind. All those grand gestures, all those declarations of love, all those moments when someone chose someone else over themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd thought they were beautiful. Had cried at them, had ached for that kind of devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those were stories. This was real. And in real life, people chose themselves. That was survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind her, she heard Kylie draw a ragged breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette looked at the two hearts in her palm. Her hands were shaking so badly the candies rattled together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Choose," the cupid said softly. "Now."
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Spring came to the college town in a rush of green and warmth, winter's grip finally releasing. The small chapel stood on a quiet street, ivy climbing its stone walls, stained glass windows catching the warm sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, in a small room off the sanctuary, Colette paced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back and forth across the hardwood floor, her elegant fitted gown whispering with each anxious step. The train pooled and dragged behind her, the low back exposing her shoulders. Small white flowers were woven into her auburn hair, which fell in loose waves. Her hands twisted together, then checked her phone again—still nothing—then smoothed down the fabric, then twisted again.
        </p>
        <p>
          She'd been texting all morning. The messages sat there in her phone, evidence of her spiral. The first had been sweet. The second, an hour later, anxious. Then: "Are you okay?" Then: "Please respond." And finally, twenty minutes ago: "I am sorry about what I said yesterday. Please tell me you are still coming."
        </p>
        <p>
          No response. Not to any of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty minutes late now. Twenty minutes past when the ceremony should have started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette knew what this looked like. She'd done this before. Obsessive texting that drove people away. But this was different. This was her wedding day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except... was it?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if yesterday had been the final straw? During the preparations, she'd said something cutting. Something harsh. She'd seen the hurt flash across—
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands twisted together again. This was her pattern. Too intense. Too much. Saying cruel things without meaning to, needing constant reassurance, spiraling over every little thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if she'd finally pushed too far?
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the door, she could hear murmurs from the chapel. The guests were waiting. How long would they wait? How long before someone came to tell her the obvious, that she'd been left at the altar by someone who'd finally had enough?
        </p>
        <p>
          The door opened.
        </p>
        <p>
          A figure stood in the doorway, backlit by the hallway lights. For a heartbeat, Colette couldn't breathe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she saw: blonde hair in soft waves. Small frame. A short dress with layers of tulle that filtered the light. White heels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          On that fateful Valentine's Day in the apartment, two hands had opened to reveal two candy hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          STAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          STAY.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a long moment, neither of them moved. Just stared at the evidence in their palms that both had chosen each other. Both had chosen trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight of that settled between them. Both had been offered everything. Both had said no. And in that refusal, in that choice to protect each other over saving themselves, something new took root in soil made fertile by sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid laughed, genuine delight in the sound. "Well! That's… new. First time in three thousand years." They leaned forward with obvious interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something in the air shifted.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't dramatic. Wasn't like the transformations or the visions. Just a subtle change in the atmosphere, like the moment before dawn when the darkness begins to ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie looked at Colette and saw her differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not just her damaged roommate. Not just her fellow victim. But someone beautiful. Someone strong. Someone who'd had every reason to save herself and had chosen Kylie instead. Someone who'd looked at the choice between being whole and being together and had chosen together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling that bloomed in Kylie's chest was warm and soft and growing. Not the compulsive sexuality that drove her to frat parties. Not the automatic affection she felt every time she saw Cole in the vision. This was different. She looked at Colette and felt something click into place. She wanted to know her. Wanted to be near her. Wanted to choose her again tomorrow and the day after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And across from her, Colette was experiencing the same shift. Looking at Kylie—small and blonde and so damaged but also so brave, who'd had every reason to betray but had chosen trust instead—and feeling something open in her chest like a flower turning toward sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not the obsessive romantic desperation that drove her to dating apps and clingy texts. Not the compelled performance of devotion. This was real. This was chosen. This was a desire to reach out and not let go. Something that felt like falling, but softer. Something that felt like coming home.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh," they breathed at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid smiled, that ancient knowing smile. "The first seeds of love," they said softly. "Earned through sacrifice. Forged through trust. Yours to keep. To nurture. If cared for well, they will grow and blossom."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you—" Colette started. "Did you make us feel zis way?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me? No," the cupid admitted. "I can create desire. You felt it in the visions. That was me." They leaned forward. "But this? What you're feeling now? I can't touch that. That's just what happens when two people choose each other."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So this is real?" Kylie whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As real as anything gets after what you've been through." The cupid stood. "You both chose sacrifice over salvation. That's rare. What grows from that choice? That's yours to figure out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait," Colette said. "What 'appens now? Are we still—" She gestured at herself, at Kylie.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm afraid so," the cupid said matter-of-factly. "That was the deal. You stay as you are, forever. You'll struggle with the compulsions that were carved into you. Nothing about that changes." Their expression softened slightly. "But you won't have to struggle alone. You have each other. And sometimes that's enough."
        </p>
        <p>
          The cupid began to fade, dissolving into pink smoke that drifted toward the ceiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Happy Valentine's Day," their voice echoed as they disappeared completely. "May you have many more together."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then they were gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie and Colette sat on the couch, still holding their STAY hearts, looking at each other in the sudden quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So," Kylie said, a nervous laugh bubbling up. "We're girlfriends now?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette was quiet for a moment, then a small smile touched her lips. "I zink so. Is zat okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Kylie said, and realized she meant it. "It's okay. It feels right."
        </p>
        <p>
          They sat there, neither quite sure what to do next. The apartment felt different somehow. Smaller. More intimate. The space between them on the couch both too much and not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette reached out slowly, offering her hand. Kylie took it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their fingers intertwined, and they sat like that for a long moment, holding hands on Valentine's Day, two people who'd chosen each other when they could have chosen themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do we do now?" Kylie whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know," Colette admitted. "But we figure it out together?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Together," Kylie agreed.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          And so it began. Not with certainty, not with ease, but with two damaged people reaching for each other in the dark and discovering that sometimes, broken pieces fit together in ways whole ones never could.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks later, they'd been on the couch watching one of Colette's romantic comedies that neither was paying attention to, sitting closer than roommates but not quite touching. Kylie had made some joke—she couldn't even remember what—and Colette had laughed, and when she turned to look at Kylie the space between them suddenly felt impossible to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was tentative. Uncertain. Kylie's hands found Colette's face, soft and careful. Colette's fingers threaded through Kylie's hair. Their lips met and it was awkward and sweet and absolutely terrifying and somehow exactly right.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they pulled apart, both were crying.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay?" Colette whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah," Kylie said, laughing through her tears. "Really okay."
        </p>
        <p>
          They kissed again, slower this time, learning each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early days had that fragile, precious quality that new love always does, terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure. They went on actual dates after that. Coffee shops where Colette ordered in French just to make Kylie laugh, dinners where they held hands across the table, long walks through campus when the weather turned warm. Stolen kisses under blooming trees, both of them giddy and nervous and falling.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was spring, and everything felt possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          They took their time with physical intimacy, both uncertain how to navigate this new territory. Stolen kisses became longer kisses. Holding hands became bodies wrapped around each other on the couch. Making out became hands exploring, tentative touches, whispered questions and giggles about the awkwardness of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          That first night they went further, fumbling and gentle and learning each other's bodies with patience and care, it felt different from anything either had experienced before. Not compulsion. Not performance. Just them, choosing each other, finding out what this could be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love doesn't announce itself with trumpets. It grows quietly, in the spaces between words, in small gestures repeated until they become ritual. It's learning how someone takes their coffee. It's knowing when they need space and when they need holding. It's choosing them every day, even on the days when choosing is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sex between them was different too. Not perfect—how could it be, with everything they carried?—but real in ways nothing else had been. Kylie's compulsion was still there, that underlying drive that had controlled her for so long. But with Colette it felt less desperate, more chosen. Colette's passionate intensity was still there too, but with Kylie it felt reciprocated rather than one-sided.
        </p>
        <p>
          They learned what the other needed. That Kylie needed Colette to initiate sometimes, to prove this was wanted and not just tolerated. That Colette needed constant reassurance, needed to hear "I'm not going anywhere" when her anxiety spiked.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't perfect. But it was theirs.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          They still struggled. They would always struggle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette still had no filter. At a dinner with the cheer team, someone mentioned the upcoming football game. Colette had announced, "I will never understand why Americans cannot watch a match wizout all ze dancing girls in ze tiny costumes shaking their derrières!" The table went silent. Kylie's face crumpled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, in the car: "I cannot believe I said zat."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You always say stuff like that," Kylie said quietly, staring out the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know. I am sorry. I just—it comes out and I cannot stop it and—" Colette's hands gripped the steering wheel. "I saw your face. I 'urt you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am trying. I swear I am trying."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie reached over and took Colette's hand. "It's okay. I know you didn't mean it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is not okay—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, it's not. But like... we figure it out anyway?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette squeezed her hand. "Oui. We figure it out."
        </p>
        <p>
          And they did, imperfectly. Colette learned to catch herself sometimes, to bite back the harshest comments. Not always. But she tried. And when she failed, Kylie learned to see past the words to the person struggling beneath them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage doesn't disappear because you love someone. Compulsions don't vanish because you've found your person. But maybe—maybe—having someone who sees your brokenness and chooses you anyway makes the struggle bearable. Maybe that's what love is: not fixing each other, but carrying each other's burdens when they get too heavy to bear alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie's hypersexuality was harder to manage. The compulsion didn't care that she was in a relationship now. When guys looked at her with that particular interest, when they wanted her, some fundamental part of her brain still couldn't form the word "no."
        </p>
        <p>
          One night she texted Colette from a party: "I need you here. Help. Please."
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette arrived twenty minutes later to find Kylie outside on the porch, wrapped in her own arms, shaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What 'appened?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "There was a guy. He was—I could feel it starting. I had to leave before—" Kylie's voice broke. "Can we go home?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the car, Kylie said quietly: "I'm sorry."
        </p>
        <p>
          "For what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "For being like this. For needing you to rescue me from parties like I'm a child who can't control herself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette pulled over, put the car in park, turned to face her. "It is not your fault," she said firmly. "You did not choose it. You texted me instead of—" She took Kylie's hand. "You chose me. Zat is what matters."
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't always that clean. Kylie slipped sometimes. Came home at 3 AM, mascara smudged, hating herself. Each time, she had expected Colette to leave. Each time, Colette hadn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          They balanced each other in unexpected ways. Kylie's diminished intellect meant she couldn't overthink things the way Colette wanted to. When Colette spiraled—convinced their feelings weren't real, that they were making a mistake—Kylie would take her hands and say simply: "I love you. That's what matters. The rest is just noise."
        </p>
        <p>
          And Colette's emotional intensity provided the passion and drive that Kylie's scattered attention couldn't sustain alone. When Kylie got lost in her own head, convinced she was too broken to deserve love, Colette would hold her face and say fiercely: "You are not broken. You are 'ere. Wiz me. And I am not letting you go."
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither of them was whole. But together, they were enough.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          They graduated on a sunny May afternoon, both somehow managing to finish their degrees despite everything. Kylie with her C-minus average in Sports Marketing, Colette with honors in Fashion Merchandising.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they received their diplomas, they kissed, right there in front of everyone, while their families cheered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their families who had no memory of Kyle or Cole. Who believed their daughters had always been Kylie and Colette, had met as freshman roommates, had fallen in love over the course of college.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative made sense to everyone. Two college sweethearts starting their lives together. Normal. Happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If only they knew. If only they understood that this love was forged in transformation and loss, that these vows-to-come would mean something far deeper and darker than anyone watching could possibly comprehend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposal happened on an ordinary Tuesday night a few months later. They were on the couch, Kylie scrolling on her phone with her head in Colette's lap, Colette absently playing with her hair while watching some French film.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We should get married," Colette said suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie sat up. "What?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I zink we should get married." Colette's accent was thick, the way it got when she was nervous. "We are already—we choose each ozzer every day. Why not make it official?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's the worst proposal I've ever heard," Kylie said, but she was smiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not 'ave a ring. I did not plan zis. But—" Colette took her hands. "I want to marry you. I want to choose you forever, not just today."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie kissed her. "Yeah. Okay. Yes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zat is a yes?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a yes, you dork."
        </p>
        <p>
          Wedding planning brought out Colette's obsessive tendencies in full force. She spiraled over flower arrangements, texted the venue coordinator obsessively, lay awake at night worrying about seating charts. When she'd texted the florist twenty times in one day, Kylie had gently taken her phone away. "Babe. You're doing the thing again."
        </p>
        <p>
          And Colette had recognized it, had let Kylie help her step back, had been grateful for the grounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the morning before the wedding, during final preparations, Colette had snapped at Kylie about something trivial. Her lipstick shade, the flowers, something that shouldn't have mattered. She'd seen the flash of hurt on Kylie's face and immediately regretted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry. I did not mean—"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's fine," Kylie had said, but her voice was tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't fine. But they'd work through it. They always did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie had gone to get ready with her family. Her phone had died sometime that morning. And Colette had started texting, anxious when there was no response, spiraling into the old familiar patterns of obsession and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until the door to the sanctuary had opened, and Kylie was there, and everything was going to be okay.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          "Are you nervous?" Kylie asked, standing in the small room in her wedding dress.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Terrified," Colette admitted. "But not about marrying you. Just about... everyzing else."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kylie understood. The future spreading before them was uncertain, complicated. They would always struggle with the compulsions that controlled them. But they had each other now. That made it bearable.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you ever—" Kylie hesitated. "Do you ever wish we'd chosen differently? On Valentine's Day?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Colette was quiet for a moment. Honest consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sometimes," she admitted finally. "When I cannot zink ze way I want to. When I feel ze obsession taking over and I 'ate zat I cannot control it. Sometimes I zink about being Cole again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me too," Kylie said. "When I'm doing something dumb and I know Kyle would've been able to figure it out. Or when I can't stop myself from wanting sex even though I don't actually want it." She squeezed Colette's hand. "But then I think about you. And I think I'd rather be Kylie with the real you than Kyle with a lie."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zat is 'ow I feel too, ma chérie," Colette said.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stood together, two women who'd been two men a year and a half ago, about to walk down an aisle and make promises to each other in front of families who had no idea what those promises really meant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A knock on the door. It was time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ready?" Kylie asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No," Colette laughed. "But let us do it anyway."
        </p>
        <p>
          They walked to the doors of the chapel sanctuary together, hands clasped. Through the small window, they could see the intimate gathering. Just their parents, Colette's aunt and uncle who'd flown in from France, Kylie's grandmother, a handful of close family friends. Candles flickered on the simple altar. Flowers adorned the ends of the wooden pews.
        </p>
        <p>
          The music started. They walked down the short aisle side by side, not willing to be separated even for tradition's sake. Both in white. Both smiling. Both choosing each other with every step.
        </p>

        <figure class="blog-post__figure">

        <p>
          Kyle and Cole were gone. Those boys who'd walked into a costume shop on Halloween had been erased, transformed, systematically destroyed. They'd lost so much. Their bodies, their minds, their futures, their very identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Kylie and Colette remained. Damaged and diminished and struggling every day. But together. Loved. Having chosen each other when they could have chosen freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the altar, they turned to face each other. Took hands. Looked into each other's eyes and saw their only witness, their only anchor, their only love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside, spring continued its work of renewal. The world turned toward summer. Inside, two people were making promises they would struggle to keep but would keep trying anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because that's what love is, isn't it? Not the absence of struggle but the choice to struggle together. Not being whole but being broken in complementary ways. Not perfect but real and chosen and earned through sacrifice that most people would never understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the kind of love that matters. The kind that costs everything and gives it willingly. The kind that looks at the choice between saving yourself and choosing someone else and chooses them, chooses them, always chooses them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And sometimes—often—always—that's not just enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's everything.

          <strong>Author's Note</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading "Hexes and Woes"!
        </p>
        <p>
          After the darkness of the ending oh “Hex the Halls,” I was determined to find a happy (ish) ending for our two heroines. But how to do that without reversing all the changes, all the damage that had been done to them over the last two holidays? How can two people this broken possibly find redemption?
        </p>

          The answer turned out to be Valentine's Day. And, oddly, game theory?

          I've always been fascinated by the prisoner's dilemma, the decision-making problem where the rational choice for each individual produces the worst outcome for both. It felt like the perfect framework for this story, especially with Kyle’s background in economics. Give our boys-now-girls a chance at salvation, but only if they're willing to doom each other. Make trust the only path to anything better, but make trust nearly impossible given what they've been through.

          The visions were hard to write. I needed you to feel the full horror of what betrayal would mean, not as abstract concepts but as lived experiences. The manufactured desires, the inability to speak the truth, the slow erasure of self over years and decades. That's the real nightmare: not the dramatic transformation, but the quiet disappearance into a role you can't escape.

          But this is also a love story. Not despite the darkness, but because of it. Real love—the kind that actually matters—doesn't fix you. It doesn't make the damage disappear. It's choosing to carry each other's grief. It's saying "I see your brokenness and mine, and I'm staying anyway."

          Kylie and Colette aren't whole. They never will be. But they chose each other, and that’s about as happy an ending as you can ask for.
