          "What did you do to me?" Logan demanded, bursting into Dr. Gupta's office without knocking. His voice trembled with barely contained emotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Gupta looked up from her tablet. "Good morning, Miss Turner." She gestured to a screen showing a looping video of Chase kissing "Elle" at the state championship. "I anticipated we might need to speak today."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Last night, when Chase Montgomery kissed me, I..." Logan faltered, gripping the chair. "I felt something I shouldn't have felt. What did you do to me?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "You experienced sexual attraction toward Mr. Montgomery?" Dr. Gupta inquired, her scientific curiosity apparently piqued.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan swallowed hard, nodding. "It's not just Chase," he admitted, his voice dropping to a whisper. "When I saw guys on campus this morning, or even actors on TV last night... there's this reaction. It all started when Chase kissed me, something happened. Something switched on inside me and now I'm suddenly, like, boy crazy? Which of your 'protocols' caused this?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "An interesting assumption," Dr. Gupta replied with detached scientific curiosity. "However, GIRLI did not implement sexual orientation modification in your case. Such changes create significant identity friction and increase risk of protocol failure."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan sank into the chair. "You're saying... you didn't do this to me?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "The neurological adjustments implemented were designed to facilitate integration, not sexual redirection," Dr. Gupta explained. "We neutralized your libido during initial phases to prevent complications. What makes you think GIRLI caused this?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Because I'm not gay?" Logan exclaimed, frustration cracking his voice. "I've never been attracted to guys. Before your treatments, my sexuality was 100% straight, until you deadened it. And now it's back, it's literally like someone flipped a switch in my brain, except I'm facing the opposite direction. It has to be something you did."
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Gupta folded her hands. "Consider your current physiological reality. Your body now has female hormonal patterns, significantly altered brain chemistry, and a completely feminized physical form. Your body is responding to its current biochemical reality rather than your previous configuration."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan felt dizzy, the morning light suddenly too bright through the office windows. "I don't understand what you're saying."
        </p>

        <p>
          "I am saying, Miss Turner, that nothing has changed. You said you were '100% straight' before. I am saying that, based on your current gender presentation, you are still '100% straight.'"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan balked. "You're telling me that after everything else you've done—shrinking me, giving me breasts, changing my voice, reprogramming my interests—the one thing you didn't deliberately change is just changing on its own?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Precisely," Dr. Gupta nodded. "The human organism seeks homeostasis. Your sexuality is aligning with your body's current configuration. It's a natural adaptation."
        </p>

        <p>
          "There's nothing natural about any of this!" Logan protested, his voice cracking with emotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          "On the contrary," Dr. Gupta countered, "the artificial components were the blockers we initially implemented to suppress your sexual responses entirely. Those inhibitors typically remain stable throughout the integration process, but the emotional intensity of the championship, coupled with your growing connection to Mr. Montgomery, must have overwhelmed the chemical blocks."
        </p>

        <p>
          "So that kiss was…"
        </p>

        <p>
          "A catalyst, so to speak. Your hormonal balance, brain chemistry, and physical form are now female. Your attraction patterns are simply coming into alignment with your current physiological reality."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan sat in stunned silence as the implications crashed over him. The most terrifying possibility was actually happening—his brain was adapting to his female body, developing attraction patterns that matched his new physiology. It wasn't GIRLI's direct manipulation but the body's own adaptability that was transforming this fundamental aspect of his identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          "What happens now?" he finally asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Winter break begins tomorrow," Dr. Gupta stated. "Your classmates will be leaving to return home. Under the cover story of taking a trip to Europe to visit your mother, you will spend the three weeks of break here at the facility, to allow you time to process your recent realignment."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Three weeks," he repeated. "And then what?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "And then you return to Westridge Academy and continue your senior year," Dr. Gupta stated simply. "Your scholarship placement depends on successful completion of this academic year, including your social integration metrics."
        </p>

        <p>
          "You're saying I don't have a choice," Logan said flatly.
        </p>

        <p>
          "There are always choices, Miss Turner," Dr. Gupta replied. "But each comes with consequences. I believe you'll find that accepting your current physiological reality will be less painful than fighting it."
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Three weeks later, Logan stood outside the GIRLI facility, pulling his pale pink puffer coat tighter against the January chill. His breath fogged in the cold air as he contemplated what lay ahead. The car that would take him back to Westridge idled nearby, its engine a gentle rumble in the winter stillness.
        </p>

        <p>
          The truth was, he'd spent the entire winter break thinking about Chase. Their kiss had shattered something inside him—some final barrier between his male identity and female experience. In the sanctuary of his isolated room at the GIRLI facility, he'd replayed the moment countless times, examining his reaction from every angle, trying to understand how his body could betray him so completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan's phone buzzed in his pocket—another text from Chase:
        </p>

        <p>
          "hope ur trip went well 😊 cant wait to see u tmrw! saving u a seat in english"
        </p>

        <p>
          His heart quickened traitorously as he read the message, a warm flutter spreading through his chest that he fought to suppress. Dr. Gupta was right about one thing—fighting his body's responses was exhausting. But he had determined he had to try.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The first day of spring semester dawned crisp and clear. Logan stood before the mirror in his dorm room, critical of every detail of his appearance.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Seriously, Elle, we're going to be late," Alexis called from the doorway, already dressed in her identical uniform. "You look perfect, I promise."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sorry," Logan replied, turning to grab his textbooks. "Just feeling super weird about being back."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Well, you look amazing," Alexis assured him, grabbing her backpack. "And trust me, people are still talking about that kiss. Chase has been asking literally everyone when you'd be back."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan's stomach tensed at the mention of Chase, a mixture of dread and anticipation washing over him. He gathered his backpack and followed Alexis out of their dorm room, mentally repeating his mantra of how he would respond when he inevitably encountered Chase.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Stay friendly but distant.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Don't encourage anything.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Keep conversation brief.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan's strategy lasted all of three periods. He was replacing books in his locker when a familiar voice behind him sent a jolt through his system. "Welcome back, stranger."
        </p>

        <p>
          He turned slowly, coming face to face with Chase Montgomery for the first time since the championship game. Chase stood closer than social conventions typically allowed, one arm braced against the adjacent locker, effectively creating a semi-private space in the busy hallway.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hey... I, um, I got your texts," Logan managed, his carefully rehearsed dialogue vanishing.
        </p>

        <p>
          "But didn't answer most of them," Chase pointed out with a rueful smile. "I was starting to think I scared you off for good."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan felt heat rush to his cheeks. "It's not... I just needed some space to think, you know?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "And what did you think about?" Chase asked, his voice dropping slightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The directness of the question caught Logan off-guard. "It's complicated," Logan replied, unconsciously tucking a strand of copper hair behind his ear in a now-habitual gesture. "Everything happened so fast that night, and then I had to leave right after for my mom's, and..."
        </p>

        <p>
          "How about this," Chase interrupted gently. "Instead of analyzing what happened, we just start over. Hi, I'm Chase Montgomery. Would you like to have coffee with me after school?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan blinked in surprise, caught between his internal resistance and the strange flutter of anticipation Chase's invitation triggered. "I... I don't know if that's, like, the best idea right now."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Give me one reason why not," Chase challenged, his expression softening. "And 'it's complicated' doesn't count."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan looked into Chase's eyes, searching for words that wouldn't form. How could he possibly explain the truth?
        </p>

        <p>
          "I'm not who you think I am?" Logan said finally, the closest to the truth he could manage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase laughed softly. "Elle, I don't think anyone at this school really knows who they are yet. That's kind of the point of being eighteen."
        </p>

        <p>
          The bell rang before Logan could respond, signaling the start of fourth period.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Think about coffee," Chase said, stepping back. "No pressure. I'm pretty sure we both need caffeine to survive this semester anyway, so we might as well get it together."
        </p>

        <p>
          What terrified him most wasn't Chase's interest, but his own response to it. The warmth that spread through his chest at Chase's smile, the slight acceleration of his pulse when Chase leaned closer, the unwelcome but undeniable thought that flashed through his mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>I want to say yes.</i>
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          By lunch period, Logan was analyzing the conversation from every possible angle, yet was no closer to deciding how to respond to Chase's invitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Earth to Elle!" Madison waved her hand in front of Logan's face. "You've been spaced out all day. What's going on?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Just... distracted."
        </p>

        <p>
          "She saw Chase today," Alexis supplied. "He asked her out."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ohmigod, Elle!" Tiffany squealed. "What did you say?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Nothing. The bell rang before I could think of what to say," Logan admitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          "But you're going, right?" Madison pressed. "Do you know how many girls would kill to be asked out by Chase Montgomery?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan took a small bite of salad. "I'm just not sure if I'm ready to date anyone right now. My life is already complicated."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Not ready?" Alexis repeated incredulously. "The hottest guy in school kissed you on TV in front of the entire country, then asked you out, and you're 'not ready'? That's insane!"
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's not insane!" Logan protested weakly. "I'm just... focusing on school and cheer and stuff."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Seriously?" Tiffany replied, indignant. "You're doing so well in classes that you're tutoring all three of us, and Coach Winters calls you the most naturally gifted flyer she's ever coached. How much more focused can you get?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "What are you really afraid of?" Madison asked with genuine concern.
        </p>

        <p>
          "There are things about me that Chase doesn't know," Logan said finally. "Things that would totally change how he sees me."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Like what? That you snore?" Madison scoffed. "We all have secrets, Elle. That's what dating is for—finding out if you like each other enough to share them."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Whatever you're worried about, Chase deserves a chance," Alexis added gently. "He's a good guy."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan stared at his salad, unable to argue. "Fine! I'll meet him for coffee. Just once. But don't make this into a whole thing, okay?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The girls exchanged triumphant looks, and the conversation quickly shifted to what Logan should wear and how he should text his response. Ignoring them, he pulled out his phone, staring at Chase's last message for several minutes before finally typing: "yeah coffee sounds good 😊 after practice Weds works for me"
        </p>

        <p>
          His finger hovered over the send button for a long moment before he pressed it, committing himself to the first conscious step into whatever new territory awaited. The response came almost immediately: "cant wait 😊 see u outside the gym"
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The days after accepting Chase's invitation passed in a blur of anxiety and anticipation. Before Logan knew it, he found himself at a small table by the window of Westridge Brew, the coffee shop near campus. Outside, snowflakes had begun to fall, creating a picturesque winter scene.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Winter break in Europe sounds amazing," Chase said, wrapping his hands around his coffee mug. "Your mom must really miss you to fly you all the way over there."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan nodded, taking a careful sip of his latte. He sat across from Chase, nervously tugging at his sleeve. His fuzzy, cream-colored sweater fit snugly across his shoulders and torso, the plush knit texture adding softness to his silhouette. He'd paired it with high-waisted dusty rose corduroy pants. A delicate layered gold necklace caught the light when he moved, small pendants resting against his collarbone.
        </p>

        <p>
          His hair was pulled into a casual messy bun, with a few soft tendrils framing his face. He'd kept his makeup minimal – just a touch of mascara and tinted lip balm – maintaining the pretense that this was just a casual coffee between friends, nothing more.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It was nice seeing her," Logan replied, sticking to the cover story he'd practiced. "She travels so much for work, we don't get a lot of time together."
        </p>

        <p>
          "My parents are the opposite," Chase offered with a small smile. "They basically never leave our hometown except for my football games. I think they've attended every single one since I was eight."
        </p>

        <p>
          "They must be, like, super proud of you," Logan said sincerely. "Having them at every game must be special."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Yeah, it is," Chase nodded, taking a sip of his coffee. "Though sometimes I wonder if they see me as more than just their football star."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan tilted his head, suddenly curious. "So what do you do when you're not playing football?" Logan asked, genuinely curious about Chase beyond his athletic reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You'd probably laugh," Chase admitted with a slightly embarrassed smile.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I promise I totally won't," Logan replied, leaning forward slightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I restore vintage motorcycles with my uncle," Chase said. "Been doing it since I was twelve. There's something about taking something broken and making it work again that just... I don't know, centers me."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan blinked in surprise. "That's actually super cool. I would never have guessed that about you."
        </p>

        <p>
          "What about you?" Chase asked. "Any secret hobbies the cheer squad doesn't know about?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "I've gotten really into poetry lately," Logan admitted, the truth slipping out before he could stop it. "Not that I share it with anyone. It's just... a way to process things, I guess? Kinda weird, right?"
        </p>

        <p>
          As they continued talking, Logan found himself gradually relaxing. The conversation flowed naturally, touching on classes, books, mutual friends, and future plans. Chase proved to be thoughtful and articulate, with interests and perspectives that aligned surprisingly well with Logan's own—not the shallow jock stereotype Logan had initially assumed.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Chase suggested a walk around campus before heading back to the dorms, Logan agreed without hesitation, surprising himself with his willingness to extend their time together. The late January evening had turned the campus into a winter wonderland, soft snowflakes catching in their hair as they strolled beneath lampposts.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I'm glad you texted," Chase said as they paused near the campus fountain, now frozen into a sculptural ice formation. "I was starting to think that kiss had ruined everything."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan tensed slightly at the direct reference to the moment that had catalyzed his internal crisis. "It was just... unexpected? I wasn't, like, prepared for it at all."
        </p>

        <p>
          "I should have asked first," Chase acknowledged. "It was impulsive. I'd been wanting to do it for weeks, and in the excitement of winning the championship, I just... went for it."
        </p>

        <p>
          He looked at Logan with genuine contrition. "I'm sorry if it made you uncomfortable."
        </p>

        <p>
          The sincerity in his apology caught Logan off guard. He hadn't expected this level of consideration—Chase taking responsibility for his actions rather than dismissing Logan's reaction or pressuring him to move forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's okay. I'm not upset about it or whatever," Logan said, finding that he meant it.
        </p>

        <p>
          "So," Chase ventured cautiously, "does that mean there's a chance for a second one someday? One that's planned this time?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The question hung between them, laden with implications. Logan knew the answer he should give—a gentle but firm rejection that would maintain appropriate distance without creating unnecessary hurt. Yet what emerged instead was honesty.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Maybe?" Logan heard himself say. "I just need things to move slowly. I'm still figuring a lot of stuff out."
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase's smile brightened the dimming evening. "Slow is fine. I can do slow." He reached for Logan's gloved hand, giving it a gentle squeeze before releasing it. "One step at a time."
        </p>

        <p>
          That small gesture—the brief pressure of Chase's hand, the respect for Logan's boundaries, the willingness to proceed at Logan's pace—sent a wave of emotion through him that was increasingly difficult to deny. There was something genuinely appealing about Chase Montgomery beyond the mere biochemical attraction Dr. Gupta had explained.
        </p>

        <p>
          As they continued their walk back toward the dorms, Logan found himself wondering if something real could grow from this impossible situation. If his attraction to Chase, however it had originated, might lead to an authentic connection that offered respite from the constant strain of his fractured existence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in his room, Logan examined his feelings with newfound clarity. Maybe Dr. Gupta was right. Perhaps viewing his attraction to Chase as a potential source of comfort rather than another violation might be less exhausting than constant resistance.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          As January melted into February, Logan cautiously moved forward. Coffee with Chase became semi-regular, their conversations growing deeper with each meeting. They discovered mutual interests in books, politics, and humor. The attraction remained, but was increasingly accompanied by intellectual and emotional connection that couldn't be explained by hormones alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan maintained careful boundaries—physical contact limited to occasional hand-holding, conversations kept firmly in getting-to-know-you territory rather than romantic declarations. Chase respected these limits with patience and understanding, never pushing for more than Logan was comfortable giving.
        </p>

        <p>
          "He really likes you," Alexis observed one evening as they prepared for bed. "The way he always finds you in the halls between classes—it's like he's literally mapping his schedule around yours."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan flushed slightly, the observation both flattering and unsettling. "We're just getting to know each other."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sure," Alexis agreed with a knowing smile. "Whatever you want to call it. I just haven't seen Chase look at anyone the way he looks at you. Not even Megan Campbell, and they dated for like six months last year."
        </p>

        <p>
          The casual mention of Chase's ex-girlfriend sent an unexpected pang through Logan—a response he recognized with alarm as jealousy.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          As Valentine's Day approached, the campus transformed into a sea of red and pink decorations. Announcements about the annual Valentine's Dance filled morning bulletins, and conversations increasingly revolved around romantic plans and potential couples.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan hadn't discussed the upcoming holiday with Chase, carefully avoiding the topic whenever it arose in conversation. The Valentine's Dance represented a public declaration of relationship status that he wasn't prepared to make—crossing a line from casual exploration into official coupling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three days before Valentine's, during their study period in the library, Chase broached the subject directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          "So," he began, closing his calculus textbook. "Valentine's Day is Friday."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan tensed slightly, preparing for the invitation he'd been dreading. "Yeah, I know."
        </p>

        <p>
          "I was wondering if you had any plans," Chase continued, his tone deliberately casual.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Not really," Logan replied cautiously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase nodded, seeming to choose his next words carefully. "I know the dance is a big deal for a lot of people, but honestly, it's always kind of overrated. Expensive tickets, bad DJ, awkward slow dances..." He trailed off with a small smile.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I was thinking maybe we could do something different instead. Less pressure, more fun."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Different like what?" Logan asked, both relieved and curious.
        </p>

        <p>
          "There's a film festival in town," Chase suggested. "They're showing classic rom-coms all weekend. We could drive in, get dinner at this amazing Thai place my sister recommended, see a movie, and be back before curfew. No corsages, no awkward photos, no expectations."
        </p>

        <p>
          The thoughtfulness of the suggestion—crafted specifically to address Logan's unspoken anxieties about formal Valentine's rituals—was touching. Chase had noticed his reservations without Logan having to articulate them directly, and had designed an alternative that maintained the spirit of the holiday without the public declaration a school dance would represent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan found himself genuinely tempted by the offer. "That actually sounds... really nice."
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase's smile brightened. "Yeah? We can keep it casual. Just two people who enjoy each other's company having dinner and watching a good movie."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Okay," Logan agreed before he could overthink his response.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Valentine's Day arrived with the expected campus fanfare—student council members delivering roses to classrooms, couples exchanging gifts in the hallways, and an atmosphere of heightened romantic expectation throughout the school. Logan navigated the day with careful neutrality, declining Alexis's offers of elaborate preparation for his evening with Chase.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's just a movie. Not, like, a huge deal or whatever," Logan insisted as Alexis rummaged through his closet.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's Valentine's Day," Alexis countered. "Nothing is 'just' anything on Valentine's Day."
        </p>

        <p>
          After twenty minutes of negotiations, Logan found himself wearing a dusty rose ribbed off-shoulder sweater that revealed his collarbones, neatly tucked into a high-waisted black leather mini skirt that hugged his figure perfectly. Sheer black tights with tiny heart patterns and black ankle boots with silver buckles completed the look. A delicate silver heart pendant rested at his collarbone, and several thin rings adorned his fingers.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Fine. You were right about the outfit. It's actually kinda cute," Logan conceded, making a final adjustment to his necklace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alexis grinned, already reaching for her phone. "Of course I was right! Now stand still while I take a pic of your look."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan met Chase in the student parking lot at the agreed time. Chase stood beside his car, casual in dark jeans and a navy button-down shirt, his expression brightening visibly when he spotted Logan approaching.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hey," Chase greeted him, opening the passenger door. "You look nice."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Thanks," Logan replied, slipping into the car. "You too."
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          As they drove into town, conversation flowed easily between them. Chase shared stories about his childhood in Michigan, his plans to study engineering at Central State, and his complicated relationship with football—loving the game itself while feeling constrained by the jock stereotype it imposed on him.
        </p>

        <p>
          "People see 'football player' and think they know everything about you," Chase explained as they navigated through evening traffic. "Like that's your entire personality. They're surprised when you read books or have opinions about politics or care about anything besides sports and parties."
        </p>

        <p>
          The observation resonated with Logan's own experience, though from an entirely different angle. "I totally get that. People make, like, so many assumptions based on how you look."
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase glanced at him with interest. "What assumptions do people make about you?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The question gave Logan pause. What assumptions did people make about "Elle Turner"?
        </p>

        <p>
          "That I'm confident? That I have everything figured out? That being a cheerleader is, like, my whole identity." Logan said finally.
        </p>

        <p>
          "And it's not?" Chase prompted gently.
        </p>

        <p>
          "No," Logan replied truthfully. "It's just... a part of who I am right now."
        </p>

        <p>
          The careful phrasing—acknowledging the temporariness of his current identity without revealing its artificial nature—felt like the closest he could come to honesty. Chase nodded thoughtfully, seeming to accept the answer at face value while recognizing the layers beneath it.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The Thai restaurant Chase had chosen was small but charming, tucked away on a side street in the arts district. As they settled into their table, Logan found himself relaxing into the conversation. Chase was surprisingly easy to talk to, his thoughtfulness defying the jock stereotype Logan had initially assumed.
        </p>

        <p>
          "So mechanical engineering? With your talent on the field, I'm kinda surprised you're not considering football as a career," Logan said, genuinely curious.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase shook his head, his expression turning serious. "Football's great, but you need a backup plan. I've seen too many guys have everything taken away in a single moment."
        </p>

        <p>
          His eyes looked off into the middle distance, recalling a memory. "For example, there was this receiver at Westlake last year—Logan Turner. Absolute legend."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan felt his chest tighten at the mention of his name. He gripped his water glass to steady himself, the condensation cool against his suddenly hot skin.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Man, you should have seen him play," Chase continued, his face animated with genuine admiration. "Six-two, built like a machine, hands like glue. Had this one-handed catch against Central State that was just insane—horizontal to the ground, fully extended. NFL scouts were at every game his junior year."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan swallowed hard, watching Chase talk about him with such reverence. The surreal experience of hearing about himself in the past tense—like he was already dead—made his throat constrict.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I actually modeled a lot of my playing style after him," Chase admitted. "Used to watch his highlight reels for hours, trying to figure out how he created separation from defenders so easily. My coach would say, 'Study Turner's footwork—that's how you get open.'"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oh?" Logan managed to ask, his voice barely above a whisper.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chase's expression darkened. "But then—brutal hit during his junior year. Helmet directly to his lower spine. You could hear it from the stands." Chase winced at the memory. "Three fractured vertebrae. Career ended instantly."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan felt a phantom pain shoot through his back, the memory of that hit still vivid in his body. He took a sip of water, trying to control his breathing.
        </p>

        <p>
          "He was NFL-bound for sure," Chase continued, oblivious to Logan's growing distress. "But he just... disappeared. Lost his scholarship, flunked out, and nobody really knows what happened to him after that. There were rumors he got addicted to pain meds, but who knows."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan's vision blurred slightly as tears threatened to form. The clinical way Chase described his downfall—like discussing a character from a TV show—made his chest ache with a pain more intense than any physical injury.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Probably for the best, though," Chase added, absently stirring his drink. "Can you imagine having your entire identity built around one thing, and then it's just gone? Guy probably couldn't handle who he was without football. I heard he completely fell apart—couldn't even function without the spotlight. That's why I'm never putting all my eggs in one basket."
        </p>

        <p>
          The casual assessment of Logan's breakdown was too much. A hot tear spilled down his cheek before he could stop it, followed quickly by another.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Elle?" Chase's voice shifted to immediate concern. "Hey, what's wrong?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan stood abruptly, napkin clutched in his hand. "Bathroom," he managed to choke out before rushing across the restaurant, barely making it into the women's restroom before the tears came in earnest.
        </p>

        <p>
          He locked himself in a stall, pressing his back against the door as silent sobs wracked his body. Is that how the world saw him? A pathetic failure who couldn't exist without football? A cautionary tale? The fact that Chase—the person who had been breaking through his defenses—could so dismissively sum up the most devastating period of his life made Logan's entire body shake with grief and rage.
        </p>

        <p>
          After several minutes, Logan splashed cold water on his face, staring at his reflection—Elle's reflection—in the bathroom mirror. The copper hair, the delicate features, the feminine frame. Nothing remained of the athlete Chase had just described with such admiration. Chase had talked about Logan as if he was dead, but was that technically wrong at this point?
        </p>

        <p>
          When he returned to the table, Chase stood immediately, his face etched with concern. "Elle, what happened? Did I say something wrong?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "I don't feel well," Logan said, his voice hollow. "I need to go back to campus. Now."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Of course," Chase said, immediately signaling for the check. "Can I get you anything? Water? Should we stop somewhere?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Just take me back, please," Logan whispered, unable to look Chase in the eye.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The drive back to campus passed in uncomfortable silence, Chase occasionally glancing over with worried looks that Logan pretended not to notice. Logan kept his face turned toward the window, blinking back tears that threatened to return each time he thought about Chase's words.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I'm sorry the night ended like this," Chase said as they pulled into the campus parking lot, his voice gentle with concern. "Can I walk you to your dorm?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "No," Logan replied too quickly. "I just... I need to be alone. Thanks for dinner."
        </p>

        <p>
          Before Chase could respond, Logan was out of the car, hurrying across the parking lot without looking back. The perfect Valentine's evening lay in ruins behind him, shattered by the unwitting cruelty of Chase's words.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back in his room, Logan collapsed onto his bed, grateful that Alexis was still out for the evening. The sobs he'd been suppressing burst forth, deep and wrenching. He cried for his old self—the Logan Turner who had been erased so completely that he was now just a cautionary tale. He cried for the strange new connection with Chase that had been poisoned by this impossible twist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of all, he cried for the sickening truth that their entire relationship was built on deception—Chase had genuinely admired the real Logan Turner, but now was drawn to the fabricated identity of Elle Turner. Every moment they spent together, every shared laugh, every look of affection in Chase's eyes was founded on a lie Logan could never explain. The guilt of this deception twisted inside him like a knife.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the tears finally subsided, Logan grabbed his journal with shaking hands, his handwriting flowing into the poetic code that had become his only true means of expression:
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 3rem; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2; margin-vertical: 1.5rem;">
          Two stars orbit one gravity<br>
          The fallen praised, the rising touched<br>
          Mirror fragments catch different light<br>
          As whispered legends brush against skin<br>
          What phantom walks between these worlds?<br>
          When admired past meets desired now<br>
          One voice echoes through shattered glass<br>
          A single heart in fractured frame
        </p>

        <p>
          His phone buzzed with a text from Chase: "u ok? just checking if u got back safe. im really sorry if i said something wrong. plz let me know if ur alright. worried about u 😥"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan stared at the message through fresh tears. What could he possibly say? That Chase had unknowingly ripped open wounds that had never healed? That the boy Chase admired and the girl he was falling for were impossibly the same person?
        </p>

        <p>
          He set the phone aside without responding and curled into himself, his Valentine's Day dress clothes still on, mascara streaked across his face. The sweet possibility that had been blooming between them just hours earlier now seemed like a cruel joke played by whatever twisted fate had brought them together.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          Logan woke the next morning to sunlight streaming through the blinds and Alexis moving quietly around their shared room. His eyes felt puffy and raw, his mouth dry from crying himself to sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Morning," Alexis said tentatively. "I got back pretty late. Didn't want to wake you."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan nodded, not trusting his voice yet. His phone screen showed six missed texts and two missed calls, all from Chase.
        </p>

        <p>
          "So..." Alexis hesitated, gingerly sitting on the edge of her bed. "I'm guessing the Valentine's date didn't go so well?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan sat up slowly, brushing tangled copper hair from his face. "It was fine until it wasn't."
        </p>

        <p>
          "What happened? Did he try something?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "No," Logan said quickly. "Nothing like that. He was perfect, actually. I just—I'm not ready. I'm a complete mess, Lex."
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an unsatisfying answer, Logan knew. But what else could he possibly say?
        </p>

        <p>
          Before she could respond, Alexis's phone chimed. "Coach just sent the schedule for the competition in Tampa. We're leaving the first day of Spring Break. Extra practices every day until then."
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan grabbed at the change of subject like a lifeline. "Nationals?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Yep. It's the big one—colleges will be scouting." Alexis studied him. "Are you going to call Chase back before we leave?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Logan stared at his phone, at the increasingly worried messages, the most recent arriving just twenty minutes ago: "elle plz just tell me ur ok. i keep going over everything i said trying to figure out what upset u. whatever it was im really sorry. can we talk about it?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "I need to focus on the competition," Logan said, finding unexpected clarity. "Whatever's happening with Chase... I can't deal with it right now. Nationals are everything we've been working for."
        </p>

        <p>
          "So you're going to ghost him?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "No. I'll text him back." Logan composed a brief message: "sorry for worrying u. i thought i was ready but i'm not. need space to figure things out. focusing on cheer comp in tampa next month. maybe we talk after"
        </p>

        <p>
          He hit send, then silenced his phone and placed it in his pocket.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Come on," Logan said, standing and heading to his closet. "We've got Nationals to crush!"
