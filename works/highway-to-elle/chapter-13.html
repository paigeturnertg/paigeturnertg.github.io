          “Second place?\!” Alexis’s voice cut through the backstage area, her disbelief echoing what everyone was thinking. The Westridge Academy Elite cheer squad had delivered what felt like a flawless performance at Nationals preliminaries, yet found themselves trailing Grandview High by half a point. “I can’t believe Bridget Miller’s team is ahead of us,” Madison muttered, tugging at her royal blue competition bow. “Her form is literally tragic.” “Half a point is nothing,” Coach Winters interjected, her expression calculating rather than defeated. “We can make adjustments before finals.” Logan nodded, surprised by the genuine disappointment flowing through him. The desire to win with this team had somehow become real despite his circumstances. He’d been so focused on just enduring each day that the depth of his investment in their success caught him off guard. During their performance, Logan had experienced something new. Unlike his first times as a flyer, where he’d found momentary peace in the athletic demands, today his movements had transcended mere execution. There was an expressiveness, an artistry that hadn’t existed before—as if his body was interpreting the music rather than just responding to trained cues. The evolution had happened so gradually he hadn’t noticed until now, on the biggest stage of the season. “We’ve worked way too hard for second place. We need strategy time, ASAP,” Alexis said, gathering the seniors into a tight circle away from the rest of the squad. She glanced at her watch. “The hotel has that conference room off the lobby we can reserve. Let’s meet there after dinner to work out some adjustments.” “We should totally add that full twisting double inversion,” Tiffany nodded eagerly. “Grandview will never see it coming.” “First, we need food and showers,” Madison declared, already gathering her competition bag. “I can literally feel my makeup melting.” As they walked back to the team hotel, Logan’s phone lit up with a text notification: “saw ur performance\! so proud of u no matter what happens tmrw. go warriors\! 💙” The message was from Chase. Brief, supportive, not demanding a response. Logan stared at it for a moment before pocketing his phone without replying. The intense preparation for nationals had given him the perfect excuse to avoid thinking about Chase since Valentine’s Day. He wasn’t about to start now, with finals just hours away. The following day, the Westridge squad returned with renewed determination. The finals brought even greater pressure—college scouts lined the VIP section and the crowd had swelled to capacity. Logan adjusted the sleek, royal blue competition uniform that set competitive cheerleading apart from the sideline spirit outfits they wore at football games. Where their school uniforms were designed for weather and mobility, these competition pieces were architectural wonders \-- skin-tight and heavily embellished with silver rhinestones, precisely engineered to catch stage lighting from every angle. The long-sleeved top featured sheer mesh sleeves dotted with scattered rhinestones and a dramatic sweetheart neckline framed by a high collar effect. Silver rhinestone trim created bold V-shaped patterns across the chest, highlighting the large metallic “W” emblazoned in white and silver. The compression material felt like liquid pressure against his skin, the fabric so dense with metallic elements it caught every beam of light from the arena’s spotlights. The high-waisted royal blue skirt sat with a deliberate two-inch gap that exposed his midriff, the waistband and hem adorned with matching rhinestone embellishments. The entire ensemble was designed not just to be worn, but embodied \-- standing with shoulders back, chin high, hands on hips in a pose that emphasized every aspect of his transformed physiology.

 From the wings, they watched Grandview complete their upgraded routine. Bridget Miller executed a triple twist that elicited gasps from the audience, her smug glance making it clear the element had been added specifically to counter Logan’s earlier performance. “She’s throwing down a challenge,” Alexis whispered. “But we’ve got something better.” Their emergency plan—a double-around full-up pyramid transition—was risky but would significantly boost their difficulty score. When it was their turn, Logan felt a strange calm settle over him. The thousands of spectators, the pressure, the scouts—all faded as he centered himself. The music began, and Logan surrendered to the routine. His tumbling pass felt effortless, his body flying through the air with precision. When his bases launched him into the basket toss sequence, he knew immediately it would be perfect. His body rotated through not just a double but a surprise triple twist that matched Grandview’s challenge. When they hit their ending pose, the audience rose in a standing ovation. Even the judges seemed impressed, one nodding appreciatively as she made notes on her scoresheet. The wait for final scores was excruciating. When the scoreboard updated, disappointment quickly transformed into proud acceptance. “Still second place,” Alexis said, her initial frustration giving way to pride. “But look—only a quarter point behind Grandview now.” “Second in the nation is extraordinary,” Coach Winters emphasized. “This team has achieved Westridge’s highest national ranking ever.” A judge approached them. “You nearly had them. Your execution was flawless, but Grandview had slightly higher difficulty values in their pyramid section. That was the closest finals I’ve judged in fifteen years.” As medals were distributed and photos taken, Logan noticed several college representatives approaching Coach Winters. One woman in a Golden Coast University polo shirt kept glancing in his direction. “That’s Melissa Hernandez,” Tiffany whispered, noticing his gaze. “Head cheer coach at Golden Coast. Everyone says she’s super demanding and has her team practicing six hours a day, but they’ve won nationals three times under her.” “She’s been watching you all weekend,” Madison added. The revelation sent a complex wave of emotions through Logan. Golden Coast University had been one of the schools Dr. Gupta had selected for his applications—a notorious party school known for its championship-winning cheer program. Now, it appeared he might have a pathway there. Logan realized that in the back of his mind, he’d been clinging to the vague hope that once he got to college, he’d somehow find a way to reverse what GIRLI had done to him, away from Dr. Gupta’s watchful eye. But a high-profile cheerleading scholarship under a notoriously demanding coach would mean four more years of intense scrutiny. Four more years as Elle. The possibility of ever returning to his former self seemed to recede further with each passing day. As they left the convention center, national runner-up trophy held high, Alexis’s phone chimed with a message. “My parents just texted—they’re outside with the SUV. They say the beach house in Naples is all ready for us. Spring break starts now\!” “Your house is in Naples?” Logan asked, a memory surfacing. “Chase once mentioned that his family has their vacation place there.” “Oh right, the Montgomerys have a condo on the north side,” Alexis replied casually. “I don’t know if they’ll be there this week though. We’ve never seen them, if that makes you feel any better.” “Elle, hurry up\!” Madison called from the SUV where Alexis’s parents waited. “The beach awaits\!” The Bennett family’s oceanfront house in Naples was spacious and welcoming. Alexis’s parents greeted them warmly as they arrived, offering a seafood dinner to celebrate their nationals performance. “Elle, you’re totally rooming with me,” Alexis said, grabbing Logan’s arm and leading him upstairs. “Makes sense for roomies to stick together.” The bedroom had a king-sized bed and a balcony overlooking the ocean. “The sunrise from this balcony is straight-up Instagram gold,” Alexis said, tossing her bag onto one side of the bed. Logan nodded with relief. Sharing with Alexis was the safest option—she’d unconsciously respected his privacy needs at school. And he knew she slept deeply enough that sharing a bed shouldn’t cause any issues. “Poolside in fifteen minutes,” Madison announced from the doorway. “I already got my bikini on.” “I, um... didn’t bring a swimsuit?” Logan stammered, anxiety spiking. The biomimetic membrane Dr. Gupta had applied created a seamless female appearance, but he’d never tested it in something so revealing. The thought of displaying his transformed body so openly terrified him. “Come to my room,” Madison insisted, pulling him down the hall. Digging through her suitcase, she pulled out several options, examining each critically before looking back at Logan. Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully, then she reached up and touched the straps of her own bikini top. “You know what,” she said suddenly, “this one will look best on you. The aqua will totally bring out your eyes.” Before Logan could respond, Madison had unhooked her blue bikini top in one seamless motion. She handed the top to Logan with casual nonchalance, now standing topless in front of him. “Omg don’t look so shocked. We literally change in front of each other all the time,” she laughed at his averted eyes. What disturbed Logan wasn’t Madison’s nudity, but his complete lack of response to it. Before his transformation, seeing a beautiful topless girl would have triggered an immediate reaction. Now, he felt nothing beyond social discomfort. “Here,” Madison said, handing him the aqua bikini top and a coral bottom from her suitcase. “Try these on. The colors will look amazing together with your hair.” “Thanks,” he managed, picking up the bikini with what he hoped appeared to be casual acceptance rather than mounting horror. “Better get used to the beach life,” Madison called over her shoulder as she grabbed a red top from her suitcase. “Golden Coast is basically this—sun, sand, and bikinis all year round. You’ll be living the dream\!” Back in Alexis’s room, Logan faced the mirror reluctantly. His transformation was undeniably thorough—the slender arms, subtle curves, and the biomimetic membrane creating a flawlessly feminine appearance with no trace of his former self. He was still reassured that he had his male parts underneath there somewhere, even if it had been months since he’d felt any sensation from them. Putting on the bikini felt like crossing a final threshold. With trembling hands, Logan stepped into the bikini bottoms, pulling them up over the delicate curve of his hips. He clumsily tied the strings of the aqua top, its triangular cups nestling against the sensitive skin of his enhanced chest. The reflection staring back was unquestionably female—petite, athletic, with copper hair falling over bare shoulders. Nothing suggested he had ever been anyone other than the girl in the mirror. The realization triggered conflicting emotions—horror at how complete his transformation was, relief that the disguise was convincing, and a disturbing pride in his appearance. That last feeling troubled him most—the unwelcome appreciation of his own femininity. “Elle? You ready?” Alexis called. “Coming\!” He wrapped a sheer white cover-up around his hips—a token gesture of modesty that did little to actually conceal anything—and stepped out. Downstairs, Madison and Tiffany were already lounging poolside in their bikinis, colorful drinks in hand. “There she is\!” Madison called as Logan stepped onto the deck, fighting the urge to wrap his arms around himself. The sunshine felt almost invasive on his exposed skin. “Virgin daiquiri? Mr. and Mrs. Bennett don’t mind if we have a drink or two, but let’s start slow,” Tiffany offered, handing him a pink frozen drink. Logan accepted the drink gratefully, the cold glass providing something to focus on besides his own discomfort. “Thanks.” “To second place\!” Alexis declared, raising her own glass. “And to beach week\!” The four cheerleaders settled into poolside loungers, the afternoon stretching before them with nothing but sunshine and relaxation on the agenda. “Elle, you need to lose the cover-up if you want any tan,” Madison instructed, tugging the sheer fabric from Logan’s hips before he could protest. He forced his hands to remain at his sides—any normal teenage girl wouldn’t be this self-conscious. The afternoon passed in a blur of sunshine and conversation. Logan remained hyperaware of his exposed body at first, but as the hours passed and his skin warmed under the Florida sun, he found himself gradually relaxing. The constant affirmations from his teammates—about how great he looked, how the color complemented his eyes, how toned his abs were from cheer training—began to penetrate his defenses. There was something almost hypnotic about the combination of sunshine, the rhythmic sound of waves, and the casual acceptance as one of the girls.

 “You seriously didn’t bring a swimsuit to school?” Tiffany commented as they eventually moved to the pool. Logan slipped into the water, grateful for how it obscured his figure. “I guess I never thought I’d need one at Westridge.” “Oregon girl,” Madison teased, splashing water in his direction. Just being away from school, from the constant pressure of maintaining appearances, allowed Logan to relax in a way he hadn’t for months. The beach environment had somehow created a bubble where his usual hyper-vigilance seemed less necessary. Perhaps it was the rhythm of the waves, or simply the psychological distance from Dr. Gupta and the GIRLI facility, but he felt his perpetual tension beginning to ease. As the sun began to set, they all headed inside to prepare dinner. Alexis’s parents had laid out an impressive array of seafood and vegetables for the promised boil, and soon the kitchen was filled with laughter and conversation as they all pitched in. “You seem different here. Way more chill. It’s a good look on you,” Madison observed quietly as she reached for a tomato to slice. Logan paused mid-chop, knife hovering over an onion. “What do you mean?” “At school you’re always... I don’t know, a little guarded? Like you’re keeping everyone at arm’s length.” Madison’s gaze was thoughtful rather than accusatory. “But today, it feels like we’re finally seeing the real Elle.” The observation hit Logan with unexpected force. Was he becoming more authentic as Elle even as the real Logan faded further into the background? Or was Elle herself becoming more real with each passing day? “I guess I’m not used to having close friends,” he replied carefully, resuming his chopping. “My old school was... different.” Madison bumped her hip against his playfully. “Well, get used to it. You’re stuck with us now.” Dinner was a casual affair on the back deck, with newspaper spread across the large table and seafood piled high in the center. As they ate, Alexis’s parents asked about nationals and their plans for the upcoming week. “There’s this bonfire tomorrow night. Those guys from today invited us. We should def go,” Madison mentioned, peeling a shrimp. “Which guys?” Alexis’s father asked, his tone casual but interest clearly piqued. “They’re staying a few houses down,” Tiffany explained. “College freshmen from Florida State. Totally harmless.” Mrs. Bennett exchanged a look with her husband. “Just be careful and stay together. And no drinking anything unless you’ve watched it being opened.” “We know, Mom,” Alexis rolled her eyes, but her tone was affectionate. After dinner, they migrated to the living room, sprawling across the sectionals as Alexis scrolled through streaming options on the massive television. “We should watch the competition footage that just posted. Golden Coast University already reposted our routine with a fire emoji,” Tiffany suggested, pulling up her phone. “Speaking of Golden Coast,” Madison said, turning to Logan, “did you see Coach Hernandez watching you? She was practically drooling.” “I noticed her watching. You think she’s for real interested?” Logan asked. “Are you kidding?” Alexis exclaimed. “Elle, she spent the entire awards ceremony talking to Coach Winters about you. You’re definitely on her recruitment radar.” The thought should have been exciting—Golden Coast represented exactly the collegiate pathway Dr. Gupta had promised. Yet Logan felt oddly conflicted. If he accepted a cheerleading scholarship at a program as high-profile as Golden Coast, he’d be under constant scrutiny by a notoriously demanding coach. What he’d been through so far was just the beginning. Another four years—his entire college experience—would be spent as Elle, likely with regular visits to Dr. Gupta for “maintenance treatments.” By the time he finished, would there be anything left of Logan Turner to reclaim? “College talk can wait. Right now, we need to figure out this beach week,” Tiffany declared, stretching languidly across the sectional. As they discussed the week ahead, Logan’s phone buzzed with an incoming text. He glanced down to see Chase’s name on the screen: “congrats on the silver medal\! u all were amazing. enjoy the beach\!” Logan quickly silenced his phone, but not before Madison caught sight of the message. “Ooooh, Chase checking in,” she teased. “When are you going to put that boy out of his misery?” “It’s not like that,” Logan protested weakly. “It’s exactly like that,” Tiffany countered. “He’s been orbiting you like a lovesick satellite since state championships. The whole school is waiting for you two to make it official.” “We so don’t need boy drama this week. This is strictly girls’ week,” Alexis declared, mercifully changing the subject. “Speaking of which, we should do face masks before bed. I brought the expensive ones from Sephora.” Later that night, after face masks and an impromptu dance party in the living room, Logan found himself alone on the balcony of their shared bedroom. Alexis had fallen asleep almost immediately, leaving him a rare moment of solitude. The sound of waves breaking on the shore below provided a soothing backdrop as he gazed out at the moonlit ocean. His thoughts drifted to Chase, and the conflicting emotions that had been swirling since that unexpected kiss at the state championship. After weeks of avoiding the situation, he found himself taking out his phone and typing a response to Chase’s earlier message: “thanks\! second place feels good. beach is amazing. hope ur break is good too“ He hit send before he could overthink it, then silently questioned what had prompted him to reach out after weeks of maintaining distance. Maybe it was just the peace of the moment, the temporary reprieve from constant vigilance, or perhaps something deeper shifting within him. The second day at the beach passed similar to the first. The girls lounged by the pool, floated in the cool Gulf water, and even happily lost a beach volleyball game against the college boys down the beach. That evening, Logan wore a simple white sundress over his bikini for the bonfire, his copper hair loose around his shoulders. The flames illuminated the beach with a warm, dancing glow as the sun set over the Gulf of Mexico. Logan sat on a blanket near the fire, watching as Madison and Tiffany flirted with the volleyball guys. Their laughter mingled with the sound of waves and the soft music playing from a portable speaker. Alexis dropped down beside him, offering a White Claw. “Don’t worry, I watched him open it,” she said with a wink. Logan accepted the drink cautiously, taking a small sip. The subtly flavored hard seltzer hardly masked the alcohol, but after their day in the sun, it was refreshing. “Having fun?” Alexis asked, nudging his shoulder gently. “Yeah, actually,” Logan admitted, surprising himself with the sincerity in his voice. “It’s been... nice.” “That’s good. You seemed stressed when we first got here,” Alexis observed. Before Logan could respond, a commotion at the edge of their bonfire gathering caught his attention. Madison was waving excitedly to someone approaching from further down the beach, her voice carrying over the music. “No way\! Chase? What are you doing here?” Logan’s stomach dropped as he turned to see Chase Montgomery approaching with two girls who resembled him—clearly his sisters. “I’m here with my family,” Chase explained. “I was just out taking a walk with my sisters.” His eyes scanned the gathering until they found Logan, who remained frozen in place, the drink clutched tightly in his hand. Something in Chase’s expression shifted—surprise giving way to genuine pleasure. “Hey,” he said simply, approaching Logan’s blanket. “Hey,” Logan replied, intensely aware of Alexis watching their interaction with poorly concealed interest. “We’re clearly going to need more White Claw,” Alexis announced, standing with a mischievous smile. As she walked away, Chase gestured to the empty space beside Logan. “Mind if I sit?” Logan nodded. He’d only had the one drink, but the alcohol coursing through his much-smaller system made everything feel slightly surreal—the crackling bonfire, the twilight sky, and especially Chase’s unexpected appearance on the beach. Chase settled beside him, close but maintaining a respectful distance. “We’ve been here for a few days, but I was trying to respect your request for space. Kate and Emma spotted the bonfire and wanted to check it out. I had no idea you were here until we got closer.” Logan felt a rush of relief. This wasn’t Chase pursuing him—just genuine coincidence that they’d ended up on the same stretch of beach at the same time. “Thanks for that. For the space, I mean,” Logan said sincerely. “You look different,” Chase observed. “More relaxed, less guarded. It suits you.” The simple comment echoed what Madison had observed days earlier, yet coming from Chase, it carried different weight. Logan was suddenly acutely aware of how he must appear to Chase—in the white sundress with his hair loose around his shoulders, copper strands catching the firelight, his skin sun-kissed from days on the beach. “Vacation effect,” Logan said lightly, taking another sip of his drink. “And White Claw.” They fell into easy conversation as the party continued around them. Alexis delivered a second drink which made Logan even less guarded, and he found himself sharing genuine thoughts about nationals and the approaching end of high school. “Golden Coast seems super interested in recruiting me,” Logan admitted when Chase asked about college. “They’d be lucky to have you,” Chase said sincerely. “Though it’s strange thinking about everyone splitting up after graduation. I feel like I barely started getting to know you, and soon we’ll all be scattered.” “Can I ask you something?” Chase said suddenly, his voice dropping slightly. “That night at Valentine’s, when we were having dinner... something I said upset you. I’ve been worried about it ever since.” The question pierced through Logan’s vacation calm. That night—when Chase had unknowingly described “Logan Turner” as a cautionary tale, not realizing he was sitting across from that very person—had been one of the most painful moments of his bizarre journey. “Sorry I freaked. It was just... a personal thing. You couldn’t have known,” Logan said carefully. Chase nodded, accepting the explanation. “I’m glad you texted back last night. I was beginning to think you’d never speak to me again.” “I only answered one text,” Logan pointed out with a small smile. “Hey, it’s progress,” Chase grinned. “I’ll take what I can get.” They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the bonfire crackling before them and the night sky stretching above. From further down the beach, Logan could hear Chase’s sisters laughing with Madison and the volleyball guys, their voices carrying on the gentle breeze. “Elle, I know whatever this is between us isn’t simple. But I don’t think the important things ever are. I’m willing to figure it out, whatever time or space you need.” His sincerity touched something in Logan—no pressure, just honest acknowledgment of the complexity. “Why me? Out of everyone at Westridge, why pursue... this? You don’t really know me,” Logan whispered, the truth finally escaping in the most basic form he could express it. “I know enough,” Chase replied, gazing into the flames. “I know you’re smarter than you let people see. I know you’re braver than you think. And when you forget to be guarded, you’re the most real person I’ve ever met.” The description reached deep inside Logan. Not because Chase had somehow seen through the Elle disguise to Logan beneath, but because he had perceived something authentic in the person Logan had become. After months of feeling like an imposter inside an artificial body, being seen as authentic by someone touched him in a way he wasn’t really expecting. The bonfire cast golden light across Chase’s features as he spoke. He was waiting for a response, leaving the decision entirely in Logan’s hands. In that moment, suspended between heartbeats, Logan faced the threshold he’d been approaching since the state championship—pull away and protect what remained of his former self, or step across this boundary into genuine connection despite impossible circumstances. With the clarity that sometimes comes from mixing alcohol and starlight, Logan realized he was tired of fighting. Tired of constantly monitoring the boundaries between acting and being. Tired of maintaining walls between himself and authentic experience. For the first time since this journey began, Logan made a conscious choice rather than simply responding to GIRLI’s manipulations. He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Chase’s. Unlike their first kiss—a shocking ambush that had shattered Logan’s sense of self—this was deliberate, a choice made with full awareness. His hands moved to Chase’s shoulders as the kiss deepened, feeling the solid warmth beneath his palms. The physical sensations were intense—the gentle pressure of Chase’s lips, the taste of salt air, the warmth flooding his transformed body. But more overwhelming was the emotional release of finally surrendering to something he’d been fighting for weeks. When they finally separated, Chase’s expression held a mixture of surprise and wonder. “You kissed me,” he said softly, as if confirming the reality of what had just happened. “I did,” Logan replied, his voice steady despite the pounding of his heart. “What changed?” “I think I finally stopped being afraid of what I was feeling.” Chase smiled, reaching up to brush a strand of copper hair from Logan’s face. “I’ve been waiting for that since the championship game.” Logan slowly leaned into Chase’s side, resting his head against Chase’s shoulder. They stayed like that for a long while, watching the flames dance in comfortable silence. As the fire crackled and sparks drifted skyward, Logan closed his eyes briefly. For the first time in months, he wasn’t overthinking every movement or analyzing every reaction. The constant vigilance that had become second nature since his transformation slipped away, replaced by the simple warmth of human connection.

 They rejoined the main group eventually, their linked hands drawing knowing smiles from Alexis and Madison. The night continued with easy conversation and laughter around the bonfire, but Logan remained acutely aware of the threshold he had crossed. By initiating that kiss, he had made a decision that would ripple through everything—not just about Chase, but about his own fractured identity. Later, as the bonfire died down, Chase pulled him aside. “I should get my sisters home. But thank you for taking a chance. I know it wasn’t easy.” The understanding in his voice made Logan wonder just how much Chase had intuited about his internal struggles. Not the impossible truth, certainly, but perhaps more than Logan had given him credit for. “See you tomorrow?” Chase asked as he stepped back. “Yeah,” Logan replied, finding that he genuinely wanted to see Chase again, to explore this new territory they had entered together. Alone on the balcony later that night, Logan stared out at the moonlit ocean, replaying the kiss in his mind. What truly shook him wasn’t that he had enjoyed kissing Chase—that much had been clear since the state championship. It was the growing acceptance that he was neither fully Logan Turner pretending to be Elle, nor simply Elle as she had been designed in the lab, but someone new emerging from the collision of them. As Logan turned to go inside, he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass door—copper hair illuminated by moonlight, feminine silhouette against the night sky. It no longer produced shock or disconnect. The person in the reflection was becoming familiar, not as an impostor, but as another version of himself. The kiss hadn’t just crossed a boundary with Chase—it had crossed a threshold in his understanding of who he was becoming. And while that brought its own complex emotions, the relief of no longer fighting against himself offered a strange kind of peace Logan hadn’t expected to find.
