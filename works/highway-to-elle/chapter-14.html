          The sunlight filtering through the dorm window cast honey-colored patterns across the floor, illuminating dust motes that danced through the air like tiny constellations. The dozen lilac roses Chase had surprised Logan with yesterday—their one-month anniversary since that first night on the beach in Naples—filled the small space with a sweet fragrance that somehow made the room feel both more intimate and more confining. Each petal caught the light differently, creating a gradient of purple and pink that reminded Logan of the sunset over Naples beach where everything had changed between them. “Here, these earrings totally match the necklace he gave you,” Alexis said, handing Logan a pair of delicate gold hoops. “Date night outfit number... what are we on now, twelve?” Logan accepted the earrings with a small smile. “Yeah, something like that.” The past month had been a whirlwind of coffee dates, study sessions that invariably became make-out sessions, and increasingly public displays of affection around campus. What began as tentative hand-holding in the hallways had steadily progressed to lingering kisses between classes, Chase’s hands growing bolder each time they were alone, exploring the curves of Logan’s transformed body with increasing confidence. Logan had found himself responding with genuine enthusiasm rather than the detached performance he’d initially expected. “I still can’t believe how crazy fast things changed after Spring Break,” Madison commented, sprawled across Alexis’s bed as Logan fastened the earrings. “One minute you’re literally running away from his kiss at championships, the next you’re making out on the beach and now you’re, like, the definition of couple goals.” Logan felt his cheeks warm at the memories of those nights in Naples after their initial kiss. The beach walks that lasted until sunrise. The dinner where Chase had introduced him to his family. The careful but steadily increasing physical exploration that had occurred in the relative privacy of nighttime beaches and secluded coves. “So what’s the big occasion tonight?” Madison asked, reaching for a chip from the bag on Alexis’s nightstand. “Chase has been super secretive all week.” “It’s just dinner at Riverview,” Logan replied, adjusting the cream-colored sweater that complemented his complexion. “But I, um, need to tell him something important.” “Oh my god, you decided on a college,” Alexis guessed immediately. “Golden Coast?” Logan nodded, avoiding her eyes in the mirror. “I made the final call today.” “Ooh, party school\!” Madison exclaimed. “Beach campus, super famous cheer program, and constant sunshine. Best choice.” “California?” Alexis’s eyes widened. “That’s literally across the entire country. What about Chase? You know he’s, like, planning to go to Michigan Tech.” “That’s why I’m telling him tonight,” Logan said, the guilt he’d been suppressing all day rising to the surface. “Before he hears it from someone else.” Alexis studied him with unusual seriousness. “He’s gonna be totally devastated, Elle. Everyone can see how much he cares about you.” Logan felt the familiar twist of guilt in his stomach. Chase’s feelings for Elle were genuine, but the person he was falling for was built on a foundation of deception. “I care about him too,” Logan said quietly, surprising himself with the sincerity behind the words. “Then why choose a school, like, three thousand miles away?” Alexis asked, confusion evident in her voice. Logan turned to look out the window, watching students cross the quad in the spring sunshine. How could he explain that distance wasn’t just a complication but his only hope for eventual freedom? That every moment with Chase pulled him deeper into a life he had never chosen? “Sometimes you just have to make hard choices for your future. Even when they, um, hurt.” Logan checked his phone as a text notification appeared. “He’s here.” “Good luck,” Madison called as Logan gathered his small purse. “Text us literally everything later\!” “And don’t you dare ghost us if you end up at his place after,” Alexis added with a knowing smile. Logan rolled his eyes, summoning Elle’s practiced attitude. “It’s literally Wednesday night? Some of us actually show up for classes on Thursday mornings.” The light moment masked the heaviness in his chest as he headed downstairs to meet Chase. Tonight would change everything—he just wasn’t sure exactly how. Earlier that day, Logan had spread the three acceptance letters across his bed, grateful that Alexis had left for her afternoon study group. The empty dorm room offered a rare moment of privacy where he could focus on the one thing that felt like tangible hope—finding a way out. Prairie State University welcomed him to their “nationally recognized athletic program,” offering a partial scholarship for their championship cheer team. The large agricultural school was only a three-hour drive from Westridge—still well within Dr. Gupta’s immediate sphere of influence. Riverdale College offered a more substantial scholarship, their nationally ranked cheerleading team consistently outshining their mediocre Division II football program. Located one state away, Logan knew it would provide no escape at all. Golden Coast University’s letter featured palm trees and ocean waves, offering a full athletic scholarship to join their elite cheer program with “pipeline opportunities to professional entertainment venues.” The sprawling California campus was three thousand miles across the country—far beyond the immediate reach of Dr. Gupta. Logan’s finger traced the distance on the map app on his phone. Southern California to Westridge: 2,968 miles. Six hours by plane. A continent of separation. Too far for surprise visits, too distant for the constant surveillance that had defined his existence since the transformation began. *Just need to get away*, he thought to himself, clicking through student housing options that would maximize his privacy. A normal dorm assignment would be better than his current situation—at least he wouldn’t have Dr. Gupta dropping in for unexpected “evaluations” and “adjustments.” His phone rang, displaying a California area code. Logan answered, slipping effortlessly into Elle’s higher register. “Hello, this is Elle.” “Elle Turner? This is Coach Melissa Hernandez from Golden Coast University.” Logan sat straighter. “Yes, Coach Hernandez. Thank you for calling.” “I wanted to follow up personally about your acceptance. Have you made a decision regarding our offer? We’re very interested in having you join our program.” The moment of truth. “Actually, I was just looking at your letter. I’m, um, strongly leaning toward accepting.” “That’s excellent news.” The satisfaction in her voice was unmistakable. “You’d be a valuable addition to our squad. Your performance at Nationals was impressive, and frankly, your look makes you prime GCU material.” Logan stiffened slightly at the mention of his “look“—the artificial creation of GIRLI’s laboratories—but forced enthusiasm into his voice. “I’m, like, really excited about the opportunity.” “We have several incoming freshmen joining us this fall, but your technical skills are significantly ahead of most. With your abilities and physique, you’ve got a head start on being competition-ready. Our intense training schedule will do the rest.” As Coach Hernandez described the training requirements and scholarship details, Logan found himself imagining a life three thousand miles from Dr. Gupta’s clinical gaze. Distance wouldn’t solve everything, but it would provide breathing room—space to figure out his next steps without constant monitoring. “So, Elle,” Coach Hernandez said, her tone turning businesslike, “can I tell the admissions office you’re accepting our offer?” Logan took a deep breath. “Yes. I’d like to accept the scholarship to Golden Coast.” “Excellent. We’ll send the official paperwork today. I expect complete dedication from my cheerleaders, Elle. Golden Coast maintains certain standards, but I believe you’ll fit right in.” After ending the call, Logan submitted his official acceptance online, a strange mixture of hope and apprehension washing over him. Three thousand miles. A fresh start. Less scrutiny. Less control. For the first time in months, freedom seemed within reach. Half an hour later, Logan received a confirmation email with a digital welcome packet. Among the orientation materials and housing forms was a photo of the Golden Coast University Waves cheer squad in their uniforms. Logan stared at the image, trying to picture himself among those perfectly coordinated athletes, performing under the California sun. He noticed how polished they all looked \- uniform in presentation in a way that went beyond just matching outfits and synchronized smiles. There was something almost manufactured about their collective appearance, as though they’d been selected or shaped to fit a specific aesthetic vision. The prospect of joining them was both thrilling and terrifying—another step into the identity GIRLI had constructed, yet potentially his only path toward eventual freedom.

 He closed his laptop, already formulating how he would explain his decision to Chase. Hours later, Logan was still formulating his explanation as he approached the student parking lot. Chase was waiting beside his car, tall and athletic in dark jeans and a simple blue button-up. His face lit up when he spotted Logan, that specific smile that seemed reserved only for him. As Chase pulled open the passenger door, a sudden impulse overtook Logan. Before he could second-guess himself, he stood on his tiptoes, one hand steadying himself against Chase’s chest, and pressed his lips against Chase’s in a brief, soft kiss. Chase’s momentary surprise quickly melted into a smile as Logan settled back onto his heels, a blush spreading across his cheeks. “Well hello to you too,” Chase said, his voice warm as Logan slipped into the passenger seat. “You look amazing.” “Thanks,” Logan replied, feeling his face flush. “You too.” The leather seat was cool against Logan’s legs as he settled into Chase’s car. Through the windshield, the setting sun painted the sky in dramatic strokes of amber and violet, silhouetting the campus buildings against the darkening horizon. The car’s interior smelled faintly of Chase’s cologne mingled with the worn leather of the seats—a combination that had become strangely familiar and comforting over the past month. As they pulled away from campus, the tires hummed rhythmically against the pavement, creating a soothing backdrop to their conversation. The drive to Riverview was filled with easy conversation about their day—Chase’s football conditioning, Logan’s chemistry exam, the latest drama from student council that Alexis couldn’t stop talking about. The rhythm of their interactions had developed a natural cadence over the past month, moments of comfortable silence interspersed with genuine laughter and shared observations. Riverview lived up to its name, the floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view of the winding river below. The lights from town reflecting on the water’s surface created twin constellations—one above in the night sky, one below in the rippling current. Candles flickered on each table, casting warm, dancing shadows across the white tablecloths and illuminating Chase’s face with a golden glow that softened his athletic features. The gentle murmur of conversation around them projected a cocoon of privacy, punctuated occasionally by the delicate clink of silverware against fine china and the subtle pop of wine bottles being uncorked at nearby tables. Once they’d ordered, Chase reached across the table to take Logan’s hand, his thumb tracing small circles on Logan’s palm. “So, one month since Naples. Feels like longer somehow.” “In a good way?” Logan asked, the question more vulnerable than he’d intended. “In the best way,” Chase replied without hesitation. “Like I’ve known you forever.” The simple sincerity in his voice made Logan’s chest tighten with guilt. Every moment they spent together deepened a connection that Logan knew couldn’t last—not if he wanted to escape Dr. Gupta’s control. After their appetizers arrived, Logan gathered his courage. “I need to tell you something.” Chase’s expression grew serious. “That sounds ominous.” “I made my college decision today,” Logan said, watching Chase’s face carefully. “I’m going to Golden Coast University. In California.” Chase’s reaction was subtle—a slight tightening around his eyes, a barely perceptible stiffening of his shoulders—but Logan caught it immediately. “California,” Chase repeated, processing the information. “That’s... wow.” “They offered a full scholarship for their cheer program,” Logan explained, the rehearsed words coming easily. “It’s a really great opportunity.” “Of course,” Chase nodded, visibly working to be supportive. “That’s amazing, Elle. You deserve it.” “I know it’s, like, super far from Michigan Tech,” Logan acknowledged, the weight of the deception heavy in his chest. “Just a few-thousand-mile commute,” Chase said with a forced laugh. He paused, then asked the question Logan had been dreading: “Why Golden Coast? I thought you were considering schools closer to here.” Logan fell back on his cover story. “I know it’s far, but it’s actually, um, much closer to Oregon—to home. Being on the West Coast again just feels right after everything that’s happened.” The lie tasted bitter on his tongue. There was no home in Oregon, no past life there to return to. The fabricated backstory GIRLI had created was nothing but empty data on fake transcripts, yet he was using it to justify a decision that would break Chase’s heart. “I get that,” Chase said after a moment, his expression softening. “Homesickness is real. I can’t imagine being shipped across the country for senior year like you were.” Logan nodded, relieved that Chase accepted the explanation but ashamed of manipulating his genuine concern. “So,” Chase said, squeezing Logan’s hand gently, “what does this mean for us?” The question hung between them, laden with implication. Logan had been asking himself the same thing all day, and still had no answer that felt right. “I don’t know,” Logan admitted. “It’s a lot of distance.” Chase was silent for a moment, processing the news. “If that’s what you need to do, I understand,” he said finally. “I just wish... I mean, we just found each other, you know?” The genuine disappointment in Chase’s voice triggered an unexpected pang in Logan’s chest. Despite everything—the deception at the foundation of their relationship, the artificial nature of Elle’s existence—what had developed between them contained elements of genuine connection that couldn’t be dismissed as mere programming. “Maybe I could visit Michigan over Christmas,” Logan offered, though he knew the promise was likely empty. “Or you could come to California for spring break?” Chase nodded, his expression brightening slightly. “Yeah, that could work. And four years goes by fast, right? After college, who knows where we’ll end up.” The innocence of his optimism—the assumption that their relationship had a future beyond the artificial constraints of GIRLI’s experiment—made Logan’s throat tighten with emotion. He took a sip of water, using the moment to compose himself. Chase was planning for a future with someone who didn’t truly exist, making sacrifices for a relationship built on an impossible foundation. “Right,” Logan agreed, tracing a pattern in the condensation on his water glass, unable to voice the truth. “Who knows.” “People do long-distance all the time,” Chase suggested, his voice gaining enthusiasm. “Video calls, visits during breaks. Michigan to California isn’t impossible.” The optimism in his voice made Logan’s heart ache. Chase was already problem-solving, already committed to making their relationship work despite the obstacles. Meanwhile, Logan was planning an escape that would make any continued connection impossible. “I guess we could try,” Logan heard himself say, the words emerging from some place of genuine attachment that had formed despite everything. Chase smiled, relief evident in his eyes. “That’s all I’m asking for. A chance to try.” He took a deep breath. “Actually, I was going to wait until dessert for this, but now seems like the right time.” Logan tensed slightly, uncertain what was coming. “Prom is in three weeks,” Chase said, suddenly looking younger, more vulnerable. “I was hoping you’d go with me.” Despite anticipating the question, Logan felt a flutter of genuine excitement. “Yeah, of course I will.” Chase’s smile was instant and brilliant. “Yeah? I wasn’t sure after the whole Valentine’s Day disaster.” “That was different,” Logan said quickly, not wanting to revisit that painful night. “This... is different.” “Good different?” Chase asked, echoing their conversation from the beach. “Good different,” Logan confirmed, surprised by how true it felt. “So, uh, my parents already booked rooms at the Westlake Grand for after. A bunch of us are staying there—Travis, Ryan, their dates. It’s safer than people driving back late, and my parents are cool as long as everyone’s being responsible.” The implication hung in the air between them. A hotel room. After prom. The natural progression of a relationship that had been steadily moving toward greater physical intimacy for weeks. “That sounds... nice,” Logan said carefully, suddenly lightheaded as he considered the implications. “No pressure,” Chase added quickly. “We can just hang out, watch movies. I just thought...” “No, I want to,” Logan interrupted, surprising himself with the certainty in his voice. A flush of heat spread across his skin, his throat tightening with an emotion he couldn’t quite name. “I mean, I’d, um, like to stay with you.” The words came out in a soft, breathless way that didn’t sound like performance at all. Chase’s expression brightened, relief and excitement mingling in his features. “Yeah?” “Yeah,” Logan confirmed, even as his mind raced with the implications of what he was agreeing to. As Chase drove him back to campus, one hand resting comfortably on Logan’s knee, streetlights cast long shadows across the familiar buildings. Logan watched the campus come into view, contemplating how completely his life had transformed in the months since his arrival. His heart felt like it was being pulled in opposite directions—toward Chase and the unexpected connection they’d formed, and toward the freedom that Golden Coast represented. The college decision had been strategic, a calculated move to escape Dr. Gupta’s immediate control. But agreeing to prom night in a hotel room with Chase? That had been something else entirely—a choice made from genuine feeling rather than strategic planning. The contradiction troubled him deeply. If the physical intimacy of prom night was to happen, he would need to address the anatomical limitations of his current state—and that meant another visit to Dr. Gupta. Later, alone in his room, Logan stared at the confirmation email from Golden Coast. His deposit was paid, housing arrangements secured, his escape route established. He should have felt triumphant. Instead, he felt hollow. The conflict was becoming unbearable—each step closer to Chase was a step away from his plan to escape GIRLI, yet each commitment to that plan felt increasingly like betrayal of the only person who had made this transformed life bearable. His phone chimed with a text from Chase: “already miss u. thank u for saying yes to prom. going 2 be the best night.” Logan set the phone face-down without responding, unable to bear the sincerity in those simple words. When sleep finally came, it brought fragmented dreams of hotel rooms with doors that led only to more hotel rooms, an endless maze with no exit. The morning after Chase’s prom invitation, Logan woke with a sense of dread that overshadowed the previous night’s warmth. The reality of what he had agreed to—not just prom, but the hotel room after—settled like a weight on his chest. He dressed mechanically, barely paying attention to the outfit he selected. Where he would normally spend time coordinating colors and accessories, today he simply pulled on the first items his hands touched—a simple blue sweater and leggings. Alexis was already gone for her morning run, leaving him alone with his thoughts. His phone display showed three unread texts from Chase—sweet follow-ups to their date, already talking about tux colors and corsage options. Logan couldn’t bring himself to reply yet. He knew what he had to do. The biomimetic membrane that had served as convincing camouflage for months would not withstand intimate contact. If prom night progressed as Chase clearly expected, his secret would be exposed in the most personal and devastating way possible. There was only one solution, and it terrified him. Twenty minutes later, Logan entered the GIRLI facility’s lobby. The receptionist looked up from her computer terminal with determined disinterest. “I need to see Dr. Gupta,” Logan said, his voice barely steady. “Dr. Gupta is currently reviewing test results,” the receptionist replied. “However, you may wait for her in her office.” Logan sat stiffly in Dr. Gupta’s office, hands clasped tightly in his lap as the reserved doctor entered. The GIRLI facility’s antiseptic smell triggered immediate memories of previous “adjustments” that had systematically dismantled his former self. “This is unusual,” Dr. Gupta noted, reviewing something on her tablet. “You typically avoid unscheduled consultations.” Logan shifted uncomfortably. “It’s about prom. Chase asked me, and... there’s a hotel room after.” Dr. Gupta’s expression remained impassive. “You’re concerned about potential intimate interactions.” “What if he, um, notices?” Logan asked, his voice barely above a whisper. “If things go... if we...” He couldn’t bring himself to finish, the words sticking in his throat as his eyes darted away from Dr. Gupta’s clinical gaze. “A valid concern,” Dr. Gupta replied, setting her tablet aside. “The external anatomical concealment protocol was designed for visual and casual physical contact, not sustained intimate exploration. Discrepancies would become immediately apparent.” She reached for her tablet again, tapping through several screens before turning it toward Logan. The display showed a complex anatomical diagram that made his breath catch. “The anatomical completion protocol would address these limitations,” Dr. Gupta explained. “A reconfiguration of existing biological matrices to create fully functional female anatomical structures for intimate encounters.” Logan’s head swam with the technical jargon, but he grasped the basic concept. “So I would... I’d be able to...” Logan swallowed hard, the clinical discussion of his body making him physically recoil. “It would... function? Like... like a real...” He couldn’t even complete the thought, his face burning with a mixture of shame and necessity. “Precisely. Complete biological function, including tactile sensitivity, natural lubrication response, and full orgasmic capability,” Dr. Gupta explained as casually as if describing how to assemble a bookshelf. “But it’s definitely reversible?” Logan asked, the question that mattered most to him. “After college, when all this is over? This would all be...like, temporary?” Dr. Gupta looked almost offended by the question. “Of course it’s reversible. I designed the entire protocol. If I can implement these changes with such precision, I can certainly reverse them with equal skill. My technical capabilities extend in both directions \- creation and restoration.” Logan sat back, considering his options. Each step in his transformation had seemed to represent the ultimate boundary—his height reduction, his voice modification, his feminized features. Yet somehow GIRLI always found new territories to conquer, new aspects of his identity to reshape. What terrified him most wasn’t just the procedure itself, but what it represented—another step away from his original identity, another violation of the body that had once been his. The thought of experiencing intimate sensations with Chase—feeling pleasure through a body configured entirely differently than the one he was born with—was both deeply disturbing and somehow simultaneously alluring. As Dr. Gupta made notes on her tablet, she added casually, “I spoke with Coach Hernandez this morning. She mentioned you’d accepted Golden Coast’s offer.” Logan nodded cautiously, surprised that the news had traveled so quickly. “An optimal choice and a truly successful repurposing,” Dr. Gupta continued. “Their cheer program’s financial resources will allow you to attend college, exactly as GIRLI promised. And of course, your membership in Kappa Kappa Phi sorority has already been arranged.” Logan blinked in confusion. “Sorority? I never even asked to join—“ “The Kappa Kappa Phi sorority maintains a special partnership with our program,” Dr. Gupta explained, her tone matter-of-fact. “Their house at Golden Coast has a dedicated room for remote medical exams and video conferencing. Your membership has already been arranged—quite the coup for a freshman, I might add.” The revelation hit Logan like a physical blow. Even three thousand miles away, GIRLI would be watching. His carefully constructed escape plan collapsed in an instant. “You seem surprised,” Dr. Gupta observed with faint amusement. “Surely you didn’t think we would invest so extensively in your integration only to abandon oversight during such a critical developmental period?” Logan stared at her, speechless as the implications became clear. There was no escape—not to Golden Coast, not anywhere. GIRLI’s tendrils reached across the country, ensuring that wherever he went, Dr. Gupta’s influence would follow. “I’m sure you’ll find the sorority experience quite educational,” Dr. Gupta continued. “I understand their annual ‘Waves and Rays’ party is”—her tone turned sardonic as she read from her tablet—“like, literally the social event of the year.” She turned her tablet toward him, displaying an image of smiling college women in matching t-shirts on a sunny beach. “Kappa Kappa Phi prides itself on maintaining certain aesthetic standards for its members. You’ll fit in perfectly.” Logan felt sick, imagining himself amongst them. Another layer of performance, another cage within a cage. The freedom he’d imagined in California was just another illusion.

 “You may retain this calendar event for reference,” Dr. Gupta said, sending something to Logan’s phone. “It contains details of the procedure and recovery guidelines. Friday at 2 PM.” Logan’s phone chimed with the notification. He stared at it numbly, trapped between impossible choices. Should he back out of the procedure, which would require breaking off the prom plans with Chase? Or proceed, giving up his last physical connection to his old body? “Okay,” he said finally, his voice barely audible as his fingers curled into his palms, manicured nails pressing half-moons into his skin. “Friday at 2.” As Logan rose to leave, Dr. Gupta added, “We normally do not schedule anatomical completion until the summer, Miss Turner. Requesting it early, and on your own initiative, demonstrates significant progress in your integration journey.” Logan paused at the door, wanting to object that this wasn’t “progress” but desperation. Yet the words wouldn’t form—perhaps because the realization that he could never truly escape Dr. Gupta’s influence had left him hollow inside. Back in his dorm room, Logan stared at his phone, reading Chase’s recent texts about prom plans and flower arrangements. The innocent enthusiasm made Logan’s chest ache. Chase was planning for a perfect prom night, completely unaware of the extraordinary measures his date was taking to maintain the illusion of normalcy. Logan set the phone aside without responding, lying back on his bed. Friday’s procedure loomed before him, threatening yet necessary. Most unsettling was the small voice in the back of his mind whispering that maybe this final transformation might bring a strange kind of peace—an end to the constant tension between appearance and physiology. Friday arrived with grim inevitability. Logan entered Treatment Room A at precisely 2 PM, his steps slowing as he took in the sophisticated medical equipment arranged around a reclined chair that looked more like something from a spacecraft than a doctor’s office. Various monitors displayed what appeared to be real-time imaging technology, while mechanical arms equipped with an array of instruments hung suspended above the central area. “Disrobe completely and place yourself on the treatment apparatus,” Dr. Gupta instructed, entering the room with two white-coated assistants. Logan complied with resignation, fully expecting to be restrained to the device as he had during past procedures. “Physical restraints are unnecessary for today’s protocols. We’ll begin by removing the external anatomical concealment,” Dr. Gupta stated, approaching with what looked like an airbrush sprayer. “The biometric membrane requires dissolution before we proceed with the anatomical restructuring.” An anesthesiologist appeared at Logan’s side, inserting an IV line into his arm. “This is just to help you relax during the preliminary phase,” she explained, connecting the clear tubing to a bag of solution. “The full sedation won’t begin until later.” The medication entered his system almost immediately, creating a pleasant warmth that spread through his limbs. His thoughts began to feel slightly disconnected, anxiety receding into a hazy distance. Through this growing fog, Logan watched as Dr. Gupta sprayed a fine mist across his genital area. The biomimetic membrane that had concealed his male anatomy for months began to dissolve before his eyes. As the artificial layer disappeared, he saw his penis and scrotum revealed—or at least what was left of them. The past months of hormonal treatments and the numbing coverage of the biomimetic membrane had left his male anatomy shockingly atrophied and useless. Logan stared down at himself, experiencing a complex wave of emotions through the haze of medication. This was the last time he would see this part of himself. Despite its sorry state, it represented the final physical connection to Logan Turner. By the time he woke, this too would be transformed beyond recognition. As his consciousness began to drift further, he became vaguely aware of additional GIRLI staff entering the room. Through increasingly heavy eyelids, he watched as they approached with measurement tools. To his alarm, they began drawing precise lines across his chest, around his breasts. “What are you...” Logan mumbled, his tongue feeling thick and uncooperative as the sedative strengthened its hold. “My chest? You didn’t say...” Dr. Gupta glanced up briefly from her preparations. “Coach Hernandez is very particular about her aesthetic requirements,” she replied clinically, her lips curling in a slight sneer. “Golden Coast cheerleaders have a certain... signature look. We wouldn’t want you to stand out for the wrong reasons.” The anesthesiologist adjusted something on his IV line, and a deeper wave of unconsciousness began to pull Logan under. The last thing Logan saw was Dr. Gupta standing over him, her clinical gaze evaluating the marked lines on his chest, as an assistant approached with a tray bearing two fluid-filled sacs. Then darkness claimed him completely.
