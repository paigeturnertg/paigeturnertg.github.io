          Logan couldn’t shake the dread that had settled in his stomach since Alexis’s text about the squad end-of-summer party. The thought of spending hours with twenty-three cheerleaders, maintaining “Elle” through countless conversations, interpersonal dynamics, and group photos terrified him. Even a simple text exchange had left him exhausted from the mental gymnastics of being someone else. After a restless night, he raised his concerns about the party with Dr. Gupta. “I could barely handle texting with Alexis for ten minutes last night,” Logan said, pacing Dr. Gupta’s office. “My hands were shaking the entire time, and half the messages I sent didn’t even feel like they came from me. How am I supposed to survive hours with all of them watching me, expecting me to act just like them?” “The squad social gathering has been on your assimilation timeline since initial scheduling,” Dr. Gupta replied calmly. “It is a critical benchmark in your placement protocol.” “But these behaviors feel completely separate from me,” Logan said. “I’m constantly on guard and worried that I’m going to say or do the wrong thing, never knowing when I’ll suddenly start saying words automatically and acting in ways I never would have before. It’s exhausting trying to maintain the ‘Elle’ act during it all.” Dr. Gupta’s eyes narrowed slightly. “The issue is that you still consider it an ‘act.’ But the experience of cognitive dissonance is a normal transition phase. The behavioral modifications currently exist as isolated neural adaptations without proper connectivity.” “What does that mean?” “The behaviors have been installed as independent subroutines rather than a cohesive system,” she explained, her tone clinical. Logan didn’t like how her explanation made him sound like a computer, but he bit his tongue. “Each behavior exists as a separate pathway that activates in response to specific triggers. Your next scheduled treatment will address this inadequacy.” “What treatment?” Logan asked warily. “A comprehensive neural synchronization protocol,” Dr. Gupta explained. “It will facilitate sustained social immersion by unifying the discrete elements into a cohesive behavioral framework.” “So I won’t have to constantly focus on not messing up?” Logan asked. “Doesn’t sound so bad.” “Affirmative. The neural synchronization procedure is already being prepared. This will give you adequate time to process and acclimate before tomorrow’s social event.” When Dr. Gupta led Logan into the treatment room an hour later, the neural synchronization equipment looked entirely different from what he had anticipated. Instead of the individual electrodes used in previous sessions, Dr. Gupta presented him with a sophisticated headset featuring multiple neural sensors arranged in a crown-like configuration, connected to specialized eyepieces that glowed with an eerie blue light. “After you change into these,” Dr. Gupta said, handing him a folded gray sports bra and black compression leggings, “we can begin the procedure.” Logan looked at the minimal athletic wear with dismay. “Seriously? I just spent an hour trying on different outfits so I could look presentable, and now I have to change?” “The sensors require direct contact with specific epidermal regions,” Dr. Gupta replied matter-of-factly. “Your meticulous appearance preparation, while commendable, is irrelevant to this procedure’s efficacy.” After changing into the clothes Dr. Gupta had provided, Logan returned to the treatment room. While still annoyed at being made to change, he was also relieved—the soft athletic wear felt far more comfortable than the skinny jeans, floral blouse, and ankle boots he’d carefully selected that morning to look nice for his appointment. “Recline fully on the treatment chair,” Dr. Gupta instructed, adjusting multiple monitors displaying brain activity schematics and what appeared to be a wireframe model of his nervous system. Logan lay back on the reclined medical chair, the cool surface raising goosebumps on his exposed skin. Dr. Gupta attached additional monitoring leads to his chest and wrists while a technician carefully positioned the advanced neural interface on his head, adjusting it so the sensors made perfect contact with his temples, forehead, and base of his skull. “This session will be significantly more intensive than previous calibrations,” Dr. Gupta explained as she made final adjustments to the equipment. “The neural synchronization protocol requires harmonized stimulation across multiple brain regions simultaneously to unify pathway connections.” Logan stared up at the ceiling, acutely aware of the weight of the headset and the closeness of the eyepieces being positioned over his eyes. His heart raced as Dr. Gupta calibrated the monitoring equipment surrounding him. “How long will this take?” “Approximately ninety minutes for the primary synchronization sequence,” she replied, checking readings on her tablet. “You may experience more pronounced sensory immersion during this procedure. This is normal and indicates successful neural pathway alignment.”

 Before Logan could ask what “sensory immersion” meant, Dr. Gupta activated the system. Immediately, the eyepieces lit up in a blaze of blue light and a cascade of images washed over his retinas. Meanwhile, he could feel the neural sensors delivering precisely targeted electrical pulses to specific regions of his brain. Unlike previous sessions where he’d remained at least partially aware of his surroundings, this treatment pulled him deep into an altered state of consciousness. The boundary between observer and participant dissolved as the images projected directly into his vision began to feel like memories—experiences that seemed as vivid and authentic as his actual past. He found himself experiencing a strange doubling of his life history—for every real memory, a parallel feminine version appeared alongside it. Hanging out with teammates after practice now layered with memories of mall trips with girlfriends. Late-night game film study sessions suddenly paired with sleepovers where teenaged girls shared secrets and did each other’s hair. The scenarios weren’t just visual—they came complete with emotional responses, physical sensations, and social understanding. The disorientation was profound. Logan could still access his authentic memories, but now they existed alongside these fabricated experiences being implanted in his neural pathways. Both sets felt equally real, equally vivid. The immersion was so complete that his sense of which experiences were genuine began to blur, creating overlapping realities that contested for prominence in his mind. In one moment, he clearly remembered being on the football field, catching a perfectly thrown spiral with outstretched hands, teammates cheering as he sprinted toward the end zone. But simultaneously, he had an equally vivid memory of watching that exact game from the sidelines, pompoms in hand, cheering with other girls as the play unfolded. The crowd noise, the excitement, the rush of adrenaline remained the same in both memories. Only his perspective had changed. Another flash: his mother helping him get ready for Halloween at age ten, her proud smile as she adjusted his army soldier costume. But now alongside this memory existed another one—equally detailed, equally emotional—of his mother helping him try on his costume for his first ballet recital, smoothing down the fabric of his tutu, her smile unchanged but the context entirely different. Both memories felt authentic, making it increasingly difficult to determine which one had actually happened. At times, he would briefly surface to awareness, catching glimpses of Dr. Gupta adjusting settings or making notes, the blue glow from the monitors reflecting off her glasses. But these moments of clarity became increasingly rare as the treatment progressed “Neural bridging progressing at maximum efficiency,” he heard Dr. Gupta say distantly, her voice seeming to come from miles away. “Cross-cognitive harmonization within acceptable levels.” Logan tried to respond, to assert some control over the process, but found himself unable to form words. His thoughts themselves seemed to be shifting, reorganizing according to patterns he couldn’t control or even fully comprehend. When he attempted to hold the most basic thought—to think “I am Logan Turner,” the thought dispersed before completion, replaced by a strange emptiness. Not quite “I am Elle,” but the absence of certainty about who he was at all. Time lost all meaning in this altered state. What felt like hours might have been minutes; what seemed like moments might have been eternal. The only constant was the steady stream of images, pulses, and emerging connections rewiring his brain to create a duplicate feminine life that paralleled his own. When the system finally powered down, Logan felt as though he were swimming up from the depths of a dark ocean, consciousness returning in gradual waves. The blue glow of the eyepieces flickered and went out, and Dr. Gupta carefully began removing the apparatus. “Neural unification complete,” she announced with clinical satisfaction. “Pathway consolidation readings are nominal. We will need to conduct a preliminary assessment of synchronization efficacy.” As she removed the headset, Logan blinked against the return of the real world. His head throbbed with a dull ache, and strange echoes of the fabricated memories continued to flutter through his mind. The world seemed disjointed, as if he were trying to process reality through two different lenses simultaneously. “Please articulate your current cognitive and physiological state,” Dr. Gupta instructed, her clinical gaze assessing his reactions with scientific detachment. “I feel weird. My head’s spinning,” Logan responded. Or, at least he meant to. The words that actually escaped his mouth were, “I feel super weird? Like, my head is literally spinning?” Logan froze in horror. He’d grown accustomed to the higher vocal register that the previous GIRLI vocal treatments had given him. But this was something entirely different. The words now emerged with a cadence completely unlike his own—filled with verbal tics he’d never used before, and the rising inflection and vocabulary of a teenage girl. His hands flew to his throat in shock. Dr. Gupta nodded with clinical satisfaction. “The linguistic matrix realignment has been successfully initiated. Your verbal patterns are already displaying comprehensive adaptation to target demographic norms.” “What did you do to me?” Logan tried to demand angrily, but what came out was: “Omigod, what did you DO to me?” The words emerged with dramatic emphasis and distinctly feminine intonation. “I don’t even talk like this\!” But the protest sounded more like a teenager’s complaint, the sentence ending with a melodic rise, vowels slightly extended, the overall affect undeniably female. He deliberately tried to speak in his original tone and pattern. His mind formed the words as he always would have, but somewhere between his brain and his lips, the pattern transformed. Even when he tried to sound more direct and use his normal expressions, his words automatically rearranged themselves into feminine speech patterns with rising inflections and emotional emphasis that felt bizarrely natural to his rewired brain. “This is RIDICULOUS,” he attempted to say firmly, but it came out as: “This is, like, SO ridiculous I can’t even\!” “It is not ‘ridiculous,’ it is remarkable,” Dr. Gupta assured him, making notes on her tablet. “The synchronization of cognitive elements means you’ll no longer need to consciously monitor your behavior in social situations. Your authentic presentation will emerge naturally without the cognitive fragmentation you’ve been experiencing.” “But how am I supposed to—” Logan began, then caught himself, disturbed to find his head tilting slightly and his hand gesturing in a delicate motion as he spoke. Though he hadn’t intended these movements, they felt strangely natural, as if his body was simply following the appropriate patterns for his words. “The neural harmonization protocol has integrated previously isolated behavioral subroutines into a comprehensive system,” Dr. Gupta explained, observing his reaction with scientific interest. “Your mannerisms, speech patterns, emotional responses, and social behaviors now function as a unified feminine expression matrix rather than disconnected elements requiring conscious monitoring and activation.” Logan struggled to process this information, a cold wave of terror washing over him as he realized the implications. The neural treatment hadn’t just helped him control the programmed routines and behaviors. It had fundamentally altered how his thoughts translated into expression. While he was still ultimately in control of his choices, whatever he tried to say or do would automatically be filtered through feminine patterns that now felt natural to his rewired brain. “Can you, like, fix this?” he asked, trying to sound demanding but hearing the question emerge with a soft, uncertain tone instead. Dr. Gupta’s brow furrowed. “Reverse it? Of course I could reverse it. I designed the entire neural matrix.” She seemed almost insulted by the question. “The methodology for reversing the protocol exists, naturally. Whether that becomes relevant to your situation would depend on many factors.” Logan sat up slowly, feeling dizzy as he looked down at his plain gray sports bra and leggings. What had seemed comfortable before the treatment now felt mortifying—being seen in such plain, unflattering clothes suddenly bothered him in a way it never had before. “Ugh can I go change?” he said, the words emerging before he’d fully formed the thought. “I can’t let anyone see me in this basic stuff.” Dr. Gupta’s eyebrows raised slightly. “Interesting. Body image consciousness has expressed earlier than projected.” Logan caught his reflection in one of the darkened monitors—auburn hair disheveled from the headset, face flushed with stress, eyes wide with uncertainty. The physical transformations had been disturbing enough, but this infiltration of his mind, this shift in his priorities and concerns, was a violation far more profound. “What happens now?” he asked, his voice soft with uncertainty, the words coming out with a natural feminine lilt despite his efforts to sound normal. Dr. Gupta regarded him with clinical interest. “Now you attend your social engagement opportunity. The squad barbecue will be your first comprehensive field test—a chance to evaluate the success of today’s synchronization. Based on preliminary indicators, I expect exemplary performance.” The next afternoon, a GIRLI car dropped Logan off at Alexis’s house. The event was a casual barbecue in her spacious backyard, organized specifically to introduce “Elle” to the rest of the Westridge Academy Elite cheerleading squad. Logan had spent the better part of the morning picking his outfit and getting ready, and arrived wearing an off-shoulder coral pink romper with a subtle floral pattern, delicate sandals that showed off his recent pedicure, and minimal jewelry that included small silver stud earrings and a delicate bracelet. The thought of meeting the entire squad sent waves of anxiety through Logan. He forced himself to ring the doorbell, clutching a gift bag containing what Dr. Gupta had called “socially appropriate hospitality offerings“—expensive bath products from a trendy brand and homemade cookies that GIRLI staff had prepared but that Logan would claim to have baked himself. Alexis greeted him with an enthusiastic hug, drawing him into the backyard where music played and a crowd of teenage girls in summer attire clustered in conversational groups around the pool and patio. “Everyone\! This is Elle, our new transfer from Oregon\!”

 The introduction triggered an immediate wave of attention as the entire squad turned to evaluate the newcomer. Logan felt a surge of panic as twenty-three pairs of eyes studied him with the focused assessment that teenage girls reserve for new additions to their social circle. The barrage of comments and questions came from all directions as the cheerleaders surrounded him, each offering introductions, interrogations, and evaluations with the rapid-fire delivery typical of excited teenagers: “That romper is literally perfect on you\!” “What’s Oregon like?” “Those freckles? So jealous right now.” “Your skin is glowing\! What’s your routine?” “Have you heard Olivia Rodrigo’s new album? It’s everything\!” “Could you help me with my Arabian sometime? “Did you get your hair done at Serenade?” “Do you have any siblings?” “Love those sandals with that outfit\!” “We have to show you our competition routine from last year—it went viral\!” “Are you wearing the new Glossier tint? The color is perfect.” As expected, Logan’s body and voice responded automatically—smiling with just the right amount of gratitude for compliments, answering questions with appropriately feminine enthusiasm, and adopting the subtle mannerisms Dr. Gupta’s protocols had programmed into his system. “Alexis says your tumbling is fire,” one girl commented. “And Coach is thinking of highlighting you in our sideline choreo.” “I’m still learning the Westridge routines,” Logan heard himself respond in Elle’s higher register. “But I’m super excited to be part of the team.” The afternoon progressed with surprising smoothness as Logan’s programmed responses guided him through the complex social dynamics of the squad. The girls broke into smaller conversation clusters, with Logan finding himself naturally included in discussions about the upcoming school year, team traditions, and the social hierarchy at Westridge Academy. Within the first hour, Logan found himself naturally gravitating toward the edges of conversations. He discovered that observing more than participating allowed him to study the squad’s dynamics while drawing less attention to himself. By letting the more outgoing girls dominate discussions, he could respond only when necessary and avoid being the focus of anyone’s attention for too long. “You have to watch out for Mr. Peterson’s pop quizzes in AP Lit,” advised a senior named Jessica. “He pretends they’re not graded but they totally count toward participation.” “And the lunch table situation is seriously territorial,” added another cheerleader named Rachel. “But you’ll sit with us, obviously.” Logan nodded and smiled, storing this information while marveling at how easily he was being accepted as “one of the girls.” None of the squad members showed the slightest suspicion that anything was unusual about the new transfer student. They saw exactly what they expected to see—a slightly reserved but pretty new team member with auburn hair and charming freckles. As the barbecue continued into late afternoon, Logan found himself navigating conversations with the cheerleaders with surprising ease. When he chose to speak, the words came out in feminine patterns automatically, his brain rewired to express his thoughts through Elle’s voice. The neural synchronization had transformed the exhausting conscious performance into something that now happened naturally—when he decided to respond, the appropriate feminine expression followed without effort. “Elle, come meet my cousin\!” Madison called, waving him over to a quiet corner of the patio where she stood with a young woman who appeared a few years older than the cheerleaders. “This is Jenna. She’s home from college for the summer.” Jenna looked markedly different from the Westridge cheerleaders. Where they were polished and coordinated in trendy summer outfits, Jenna wore simple jean shorts and a faded t-shirt with “THE FUTURE IS FEMALE” emblazoned across the front. Her dark hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, and she wore minimal makeup compared to the squad’s carefully contoured faces. He couldn’t help but think that the former Logan would have dismissed Jenna immediately based on her practical appearance alone. “Hey, nice to meet you,” Jenna said with a casual nod, her gaze more direct and assessing than the evaluative looks Logan had received from the cheerleaders. “You’re the new transfer student joining the squad? Mads says this party’s all for you.” “Yeah, I just moved here from Oregon,” Logan replied, hearing his words emerge with Elle’s practiced backstory and vocal cadence. “It’s my senior year, so I’m trying to make the most of it? The squad seems super talented.” Madison’s phone chimed with a notification. “Oops, Tiffany needs help with the playlist. I’ll be right back\!” She hurried off, leaving Logan alone with Jenna. “So, Oregon, huh?” Jenna said, leaning against the patio railing. “That’s a long way to transfer for senior year. Most kids wouldn’t want to start over somewhere new right before graduation.” There was something different about Jenna’s conversation style—more substantive, more probing than the cheerleaders’ social chatter. Logan felt an unexpected sense of relief at speaking with someone who seemed interested in actual information rather than social positioning. “Transferring wasn’t exactly my choice,” Logan replied, appreciating the irony that this was perhaps the only truthful part of his backstory. “My mom took a job overseas, so boarding school was the only option.” “Your situation sounds complicated,” Jenna observed, studying him with subtle intensity. “I’m actually researching similar dynamics at Central State. My senior thesis is on performative femininity in competitive cheer culture.” She gestured toward the cheerleaders across the yard. “Ever think about how much time and energy goes into maintaining this appearance standard?” Logan felt a jolt of interest—here was someone with a critical perspective who might understand his situation. “I haven’t really thought about it that way before?” Logan responded, hearing his voice rise at the end of the sentence in typical teenage-girl fashion. “But I can totally see what you mean. Like, I spent almost two hours getting ready today, and Alexis told me that was the bare minimum for team events.” “That’s exactly what I’m talking about,” Jenna said, seeming pleased by his response. “From a feminist perspective, it’s fascinating how cheer culture requires this dual performance—incredible athleticism paired with hyper-feminine presentation.” “The tumbling and stunting are actually really challenging,” Logan heard himself saying, realizing that this statement reflected his genuine appreciation for the athletic demands he’d experienced. “But you’re right—no one talks about how hard we work, just whether our hair ribbons match.” Jenna nodded thoughtfully. “It’s the same thing women face in so many areas—be exceptional at what you do, but make it seem effortless, and look perfect while doing it.” She gestured toward Logan’s carefully styled hair. “Your body is literally your performance medium, but your appearance gets judged more than your athletic skill.” This was the perfect opening. Logan tried to say, “I know exactly what you mean because I used to be judged only on athletic performance when I played football,” but what emerged was: “I know exactly what you mean\! My last school was way less intense about appearance. Here, everyone’s like, super focused on the whole package.” Jenna raised an eyebrow, momentarily interested. “Oh? What was different about your old school’s approach?” Logan tried to explain his football background again, but found his words automatically redirecting. “We just didn’t have the same budget for uniforms, and our coach was way more focused on competitions than how we looked. But here literally everything’s about the Westridge image. I had to totally update my wardrobe since moving here\!’ Though not what he’d intended to say, Logan realized these statements were all technically true. His football coach at Westlake had indeed cared more about performance than appearance, the athletic budget had been focused on equipment rather than uniforms, and saying that had been forced to completely overhaul his wardrobe was the understatement of the century. “That’s capitalism working through gender performance,” Jenna replied, but her expression had begun to show the polite disinterest of someone realizing a conversation won’t be as intellectually stimulating as they’d hoped. “Commodifying femininity through consumption practices.” “Right\! Like, I had to buy all these specific products just for my hair,” Logan heard himself say, gesturing to his styled auburn waves. “And you should see how many different makeup items we have to buy for game day. It’s crazy expensive.” Jenna’s enthusiasm visibly dimmed. “Mmm, yeah. Anyway, I should probably help with the food. Nice meeting you, Elle.” As Jenna walked away, Logan stood frozen, a pleasant smile still fixed on his face while internally processing what had just happened. He’d met someone who literally studied gender performance, who might have been able to help him with his bizarre situation, yet his newly rewired brain had automatically filtered his thoughts into typical teenage-girl concerns about shopping and appearance. No matter what he’d tried, he just couldn’t get the right words to escape his lips. The most disturbing part wasn’t that he couldn’t say exactly what he wanted—it was that in the moment, those superficial concerns had genuinely felt important to him. The neural synchronization hadn’t just changed his speech patterns; it had altered how his thoughts formed and which aspects of a situation his mind prioritized. He hadn’t been pretending to care about beauty products and fashion—for those brief moments, he actually had cared about them, his brain automatically emphasizing those details while downplaying the more substantial aspects of his predicament. The cheerleaders’ laughter rang across the backyard as they gathered for a group photo, calling for “Elle” to join them. Logan’s body responded, moving toward the group with a bright smile, the moment of self-awareness already fading as his rewired brain redirected his attention to social integration with the squad. “Elle\! I need you in this photo\!” Alexis called, waving him over to where several girls were posing by the pool. Logan dutifully joined them, smiling on cue as someone’s phone camera clicked. Immediately after, he drifted back toward the perimeter of the gathering, finding a quiet spot near the refreshment table. This wallflower strategy had served him well throughout the day—present enough to be accepted by the group, but peripheral enough to minimize attention. And the solitude let him clear his head of fashion and cheer for a few blessed moments. By the gathering’s end, Logan had been thoroughly integrated into the squad’s social structure. Phone numbers had been exchanged, group texts established, and plans made for shopping trips and coffee dates before the school year began. The seamless acceptance was both relieving and deeply disturbing—evidence of how completely his transformation had progressed. Back in his summer apartment, Logan sat on the edge of his bed, thinking about his encounter with Jenna. Her analysis of gender performance in cheerleading had hit uncomfortably close to home, and he couldn’t help but wonder if she might have understood his situation if only he could have explained it. He stared at his phone screen, now displaying a group chat that the cheerleaders had added him to, already filling with messages about outfit coordination for the next team meeting and inside jokes from previous years that he was expected to find amusing. When he decided to respond, his thumbs typed out messages with emojis and enthusiastic agreement to plans being made for the days ahead. “This isn’t me,” he whispered, looking at his latest message that read: “cant wait\! CU all there\! 👍” in response to a back-to-school shopping trip suggestion. Yet when he had chosen to reply, that’s exactly how his thoughts had translated into text—not because someone else was controlling his fingers, but because his brain now automatically expressed his responses in Elle’s voice and style. Looking at his reflection in the phone screen, Logan made a decision. His panic—a nearly constant companion since he’d arrived at GIRLI—began to be replaced by a steely resolve. This had gone too far. No chance at a scholarship was worth losing himself entirely. The realization crystallized with sudden clarity—he needed to expose GIRLI, to tell the authorities what was happening to him. He’d go to the police, explain everything, find someone who could reverse the procedures. Even if it meant losing his athletic future, spending his life as a college dropout in some dead-end job. At least he’d be himself, not this fabricated persona gradually overtaking everything he’d ever been. But when he picked up his phone to call the police, a wave of paralyzing anxiety immediately washed over him. What would they think if he tried to explain his situation? They’d assume he was mentally ill. They might call Dr. Gupta. What if they sent him back to her and she decided he was too much trouble? What if she made things worse as punishment? The thought of trying to explain to strangers that he was really a college football player transformed into a high school cheerleader suddenly seemed ridiculous, even to him. Who would possibly believe such a story? These anxious thoughts cascaded automatically through his mind, seeming to arise naturally whenever he considered exposing GIRLI. The visceral terror went far beyond his everyday fear of discovery. It felt as if “Elle” herself feared for her very existence if the truth were to be revealed. It suddenly dawned on him. The neural synchronization hadn’t just altered his speech patterns—it had restructured his thought processes around self-preservation of his cover identity. Trying a different tack, Logan pulled out the business card his ex Kayla had given him, staring at the phone number. Here was his chance—someone who knew him, who had sensed something was off when they’d met in the mall. If he could just communicate with her somehow. But he could not break through the wall of implanted anxiety to type out a text or dial the phone. He reached for a pen, thinking he could write what he couldn’t say. But as he tried to form the words “Help me, I’m trapped” on paper, his hand shook violently, then shifted to writing “Elle Catherine Turner” in a looping feminine script that wasn’t his.Logan’s blood ran cold. The neural blocks extended to written communication as well. Dr. Gupta had thought of everything.

 Logan crumpled the paper in frustration, tears forming in his eyes—another unwelcome side effect of the “emotional recalibration” that had made his feelings more readily accessible. Where once he might have channeled frustration into cold determination, he now experienced it as overwhelming emotion that spilled over into physical manifestation. His phone chimed with a notification. When he checked the screen, he felt an overwhelming flash of anger. It was a text from Dr. Gupta: “Social integration assessment complete. Report to GIRLI tomorrow at 8 AM. I have a first day of school gift for you.” One thing was certain—he couldn’t continue like this, watching helplessly as “Elle” took more and more control of his existence. Tomorrow morning, he would confront Dr. Gupta directly. Neural blocks or not, he would find a way to make her understand that this had gone too far. The chance of getting back into college simply wasn’t worth the complete erasure of his identity.
