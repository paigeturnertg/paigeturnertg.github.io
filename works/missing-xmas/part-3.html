        <p class="drop-cap">Mark barely slept. Every time he closed his eyes, he felt them. The breasts, shifting against his nightgown&#39;s fabric. And Emma&#39;s words kept echoing in his head.</p>
<p>&quot;The town has a way of giving people what they need.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn&#39;s first light finally began to creep through the lace curtains and Mark gave up on sleep. Throwing off the covers, he noticed the nightgown was even tighter across his chest.</p>
<p>Mark sat up slowly, looking down. The fabric was tented in a way it hadn&#39;t been last night. He touched his chest through the cotton and felt more weight, more fullness.</p>
<p>He got out of bed and went to the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>The breasts were larger. Noticeably larger. Not the small growths from last night. These were proper breasts, A-cup at least, with more shape and definition. When he moved, they moved naturally with his body.</p>
<p>And his hair-</p>
<p>Mark touched his hair with shaking hands. It was longer, falling well past his shoulders now instead of just brushing them. And the color had changed. No longer the dark brown he&#39;d had his whole life, but a lighter, warmer brown with golden tones visible in the morning light.</p>
<p>He ran his fingers through it, feeling the length, the softness. It was his hair, but it wasn&#39;t. Just like these breasts were his, but they weren&#39;t.</p>
<p>The transformation had accelerated overnight.</p>
<p>Heart pounding, Mark pulled at the hem of the nightgown, pushed down the waistband of his panties, and looked.</p>
<p>Everything was still there. But smaller. Much smaller. His penis had shrunk to barely more than a nub, his testicles drawn up tight and diminished. He touched himself with trembling fingers, confirming what he was seeing.</p>
<p>Still there. But for how much longer?</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s lip quivered. This was real. This was happening. His body was changing whether he wanted it to or not.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out,&quot; a voice in his head screamed. &quot;Get out of Pine Hollow before you change completely.&quot;</p>
<p>But if he was going to reverse this, he needed answers first. Mark took a shaky breath and reached for the nude bra Claire had provided. He fastened it-easier now, his fingers knew the motion-and adjusted it. The cups filled completely with his real breasts. No forms needed. No padding. Just him.</p>
<p>The matching nude panties came next, sliding up his legs and settling over hips that were undeniably wider than they&#39;d been three days ago. The fabric hugged curves that were his own now. His shrunken genitalia barely registered under the delicate fabric.</p>
<p>Then the jeans from last night. Mark stepped into them and pulled them up. They slid on easily, no resistance. No need to adjust anything, no need to tuck or arrange. The jeans fit his body perfectly, hugging his hips and thighs, the waistband sitting snugly at his narrow waist.</p>
<p>He looked at himself in the mirror. The jeans and bra showed the truth: his body had changed. Was still changing. By tomorrow morning, would there be anything left of Mark at all?</p>
<p>By eight-thirty, Mark was dressed in the brown boots and cream blouse, his hands shaking as he did his makeup as best he could, remembering Elise&#39;s instructions. The berry nails caught his attention every time his hands moved. The lash extensions made his eyes look huge and feminine. His reflection showed a woman with medium brown hair and real breasts getting ready for the day.</p>
<p>He grabbed his purse and Emily&#39;s purple coat and headed out, needing answers.</p>
<p>The community center was already bustling when he arrived. The space was organized chaos, everyone working together towards their common goal.</p>
<p>Emma stood near the stage, clipboard in hand, checking things off a list.</p>
<p>Mark walked straight to her. &quot;Can we talk? Privately?&quot;</p>
<p>Emma looked up, surprised. &quot;Sure. Everything okay?&quot;</p>
<p>They stepped into a side hallway, away from the noise. Mark&#39;s heart was pounding.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday,&quot; Mark said, trying to keep his voice steady. &quot;You said something. About Pine Hollow giving people what they need.&quot;</p>
<p>Emma&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you mean by that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-&quot; Emma looked confused. &quot;It&#39;s just something people say? Like &#39;there&#39;s magic in the air&#39; or whatever. Small town mysticism. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark searched her face. She looked genuinely puzzled, not evasive. Not guilty.</p>
<p>&quot;Has anything... strange happened since I got here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Strange how?&quot; Emma tilted her head. &quot;Holly, are you feeling alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark looked at her. Really looked at her. Emma had no idea. She wasn&#39;t behind this. She didn&#39;t know anything about what was happening to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Mark said, forcing a smile. &quot;Sorry. I just... didn&#39;t sleep well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got coffee and donuts in the kitchen if you need some fuel.&quot; Emma squeezed his arm. &quot;And thanks for coming to help. We can use all the hands we can get.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark followed her back into the main hall, feeling foolish. What had he expected her to say? That there was magic in the water? That the town was casting spells on him? That was insane. Magic wasn&#39;t real.</p>
<p>But his breasts were real. The changes to his body were real.</p>
<p>Mark spent the next hours hanging garland, arranging chairs, helping wherever he was needed. But his mind was racing the entire time.</p>
<p>If Emma didn&#39;t do this, then what was happening? Something he was eating? Was Patricia drugging him? No, that was crazy. Was it the air? Some kind of environmental trigger he couldn&#39;t identify?</p>
<p>He needed to leave. Get out of Pine Hollow before whatever this was went any further. His car was at the inn. He could go, drive back to LA, figure this out somewhere that wasn&#39;t actively changing him.</p>
<p>By eleven, Mark made his excuses and left.</p>
<p>Emma watched him go. Across the room, her wife Jessica looked up from the craft table where she was helping kids make ornaments. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>Jessica raised an eyebrow, a question. Emma&#39;s slight nod was barely perceptible. Then she turned back to her clipboard, a small smile playing at her lips.</p>
<p>Some things couldn&#39;t be rushed. Some things people needed to figure out on their own.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Back at the inn, Mark went straight to his room, giving only a clipped response to Patricia&#39;s warm hello. He&#39;d leave now. Just get in the car and go.</p>
<p>He looked around for his suitcase before remembering Emma still had it.</p>
<p>Fine. He didn&#39;t need it. He could stop at a Target or something on the way to the airport, buy a men&#39;s t-shirt and jeans, change in the bathroom. He&#39;d look ridiculous but he&#39;d be away from here.</p>
<p>Mark grabbed his messenger bag and reached for his laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop.</p>
<p>The article. His deadline. Tomorrow. Shit.</p>
<p>Mark stood there, laptop in hand, and felt his resolve crumble. If he left now, spent the next several hours driving, even more flying home, he&#39;d never make his deadline. He needed to write it first. Today. Then he could leave this afetrnoon.</p>
<p>Mark sat heavily on the bed and opened his laptop. He opened a new document, stared at the blank screen, and started typing.</p>
<p>*Pine Hollow (pop. 1,200) is the kind of town that appears on Christmas cards-picturesque main street, historic buildings, a town square that could be a movie set. This weekend, they&#39;re hosting their annual Christmas Festival, a tradition that draws tourists from across the region.*</p>
<p>He stopped. Read it back. It was fine. Boring.</p>
<p>Mark deleted it and started again.</p>
<p>*The Pine Hollow Christmas Festival is under threat. Not from budget cuts or lack of interest, but from progress. Luke Shepherd, owner of Shepherd Tree Farm, is selling his family&#39;s land to a data center developer. The farm has been the centerpiece of the festival for three generations, but after his wife&#39;s death, Shepherd is ready to move on.*</p>
<p>Better. More honest. But still missing something.</p>
<p>Mark stopped and started, struggling for the next two hours to get his article written, deleting words almost as fast as he wrote them. He stared at the screen. He had all the pieces. The farm sale. The threat to local businesses. The town&#39;s dependence on Christmas tourism. Sarah&#39;s worried face. Claire&#39;s sadness. Emma&#39;s resigned acceptance.</p>
<p>And Luke. Luke&#39;s pain, his guilt, his struggle between grief and responsibility.</p>
<p>But how did it all fit together? What was the story actually about?</p>
<p>Mark closed the laptop. He couldn&#39;t write this yet. He didn&#39;t understand it yet.</p>
<p>The festival started at six. The pageant at seven. If he was going to write about Pine Hollow&#39;s Christmas tradition, he needed to see it. The moment when everything came together, when the town showed what it was really about.</p>
<p>A few more hours. That&#39;s all. He&#39;d see the festival, get what he needed for the article, write it tonight, and leave right afterwards, before anything else could change.</p>
<p>Mark looked at the garment bag hanging on the closet door. Inside was the formal dress Claire had provided for tonight.</p>
<p>He looked down at himself. The breasts were even more prominent now in the afternoon light. B-cup, definitely. Real weight, real shape. His waist was narrow, his hips curved. His thighs were fuller, softer. His face in the mirror was delicate, feminine, framed by hair that now fell well past his shoulders in waves of medium brown with warm golden highlights.</p>
<p>He&#39;d come this far. Might as well finish what he started.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The festival was already in full swing by six-thirty. The town square had been transformed. Lights strung everywhere, vendor booths selling crafts and hot drinks, music playing from speakers. The ice rink was crowded with skaters. Children ran between the booths with hot chocolate. Adults gathered in clusters, laughing and talking.</p>
<p>It looked exactly like something out of a Hallmark movie, Luke Shepherd thought.</p>
<p>The community center was crowded within minutes of the doors opening. Families filed in, taking seats in the rows of chairs facing the small stage. Children ran around excitedly while parents tried to corral them. The air smelled of pine and cinnamon, and Christmas music played softly from speakers.</p>
<p>Luke stood near the back, Lily having already been whisked away to the backstage area with the other pageant kids. He wore dark jeans, a white button-down shirt, and a dark jacket. He&#39;d shaved and styled his dark hair. He looked uncomfortable, making polite conversation with neighbors while keeping his distance from the main crowd.</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t want to be here. Every conversation carried undertones of loss, of sadness over the town&#39;s future. People tried to be cordial, but Luke couldn&#39;t help feeling like they all blamed him for what was going to happen to them. It was exhausting. But Lily had been so excited, and he couldn&#39;t disappoint her. So he&#39;d smile through the conversations, watch his daughter be an angel, then leave as soon as politely possible.</p>
<p>Luke glanced toward the door-</p>
<p>And froze.</p>
<p>A woman stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the evening light. She was scanning the crowd, her posture uncertain, like she wasn&#39;t sure she belonged there.</p>
<p>Then she stepped fully into the light, and Luke&#39;s heart stopped.</p>
<p>Holly.</p>

          <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">Holly Arrives</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>She wore a wine-red velvet dress that seemed to glow in the warm lighting. The fitted bodice had a sweetheart neckline edged with delicate crystal details that shimmered like stars. Three-quarter sleeves covered her arms, and a thin satin sash emphasized her waist. The skirt fell to just below her knees in soft, elegant folds that moved gracefully with each step.</p>
<p>Her hair, falling past her shoulders in glossy waves, was a warm medium brown with golden highlights. Her makeup was minimal, subtle but polished, making her eyes look huge with those dramatic lashes. She clutched a small purse in her hands, each finger tipped with a berry-colored nail.</p>
<p>She looked beautiful. Not pretty, not cute. Beautiful. Like she&#39;d stepped out of one of those classic Christmas movies, the heroine arriving at the town dance.</p>
<p>Luke couldn&#39;t move. Couldn&#39;t breathe. He just stared as Holly&#39;s eyes swept the room, nervous and searching.</p>
<p>Then her gaze found his.</p>
<p>For a moment, they just looked at each other across the crowded room. Luke saw her expression shift. Relief, maybe? Or nervousness? She took a breath, then started walking toward him.</p>
<p>People noticed. Conversations paused. Heads turned to watch Holly cross the room in that stunning velvet dress.</p>
<p>She stopped in front of him, and Luke realized he was supposed to say something.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi,&quot; he managed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi.&quot; Her voice was soft, uncertain. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if I should come.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke was still staring. He couldn&#39;t help it. The dress, the way it fit her, the crystal details sparkling in the light. Her soft hair, her plump lips begging to be kissed. The way she looked at him with those big eyes, waiting for him to respond.</p>
<p>&quot;You look...&quot; Luke&#39;s voice came out rough. He cleared his throat and tried again. &quot;You look incredible. I mean, wow. That dress is-you&#39;re-&quot; He stopped, feeling his face heat. &quot;Sorry. I&#39;m not usually this tongue-tied.&quot;</p>
<p>A small smile touched Holly&#39;s lips. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m nervous too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be. You look...&quot; Luke shook his head, giving up on words. &quot;Really beautiful, Holly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, a gesture so naturally feminine and vulnerable it made Luke&#39;s chest ache. &quot;Claire picked it out. I think she went a little overboard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She didn&#39;t.&quot; Luke couldn&#39;t stop looking at her. The velvet begged to be touched, rich and festive. The sweetheart neckline was elegant without being revealing. The whole effect was stunning. &quot;It&#39;s perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s cheeks flushed pink. &quot;Luke-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dad!&quot; Lily appeared, bursting through the crowd in her angel costume, complete with wings and a tinsel halo. &quot;Holly! You came! And you look so pretty!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, sweetheart.&quot; Holly crouched down carefully in the dress. &quot;You look beautiful too. Are you ready for your big moment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m so nervous!&quot; Lily bounced on her toes. &quot;What if I forget my line?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You won&#39;t,&quot; Luke said gently. &quot;You&#39;ve practiced a hundred times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Patricia says we&#39;re starting soon.&quot; Lily grabbed both their hands. &quot;You have to sit together so I can see you both!&quot;</p>
<p>Before either of them could respond, Lily had dragged them toward a pair of empty seats near the middle of the room. Luke found himself sitting next to Holly, close enough that he could smell her scent-something light and floral-and feel the soft velvet of her dress brush against his hand.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed. Patricia walked to the front and welcomed everyone. The pageant was about to begin.</p>
<p>Luke was acutely aware of Holly beside him. The way she sat, the way the dress draped across her lap, the way her hands were folded nervously in front of her. The way she bit her lip slightly, watching the stage.</p>
<p>He should be focused on Lily. On his daughter&#39;s big moment.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#39;t stop looking at Holly.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The pageant was charming in the way that small-town productions always were. The children were adorable, some forgetting their lines, others projecting their voices too loudly. Mary and Joseph made their way to the stable. The shepherds watched their flocks. The wise men brought their gifts.</p>
<p>And then the angels appeared.</p>
<p>Lily stood center stage in her white robe and tinsel halo, her wings slightly crooked. She looked so small up there, so brave.</p>
<p>&quot;Fear not!&quot; Lily proclaimed, her voice clear and strong. &quot;For behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy!&quot;</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s chest swelled with pride. She&#39;d done it. Perfect.</p>
<p>He glanced at Holly and found her smiling, her eyes a little misty. When she noticed him looking, she whispered, &quot;She&#39;s wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Luke said softly. &quot;She is.&quot;</p>
<p>Their eyes held for a moment longer than necessary. Luke felt something shift in his chest, something warm and terrifying.</p>
<p>The pageant ended to enthusiastic applause. Parents rushed forward to collect their children. Lily found them immediately, throwing herself into Luke&#39;s arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see? Did you see? I didn&#39;t mess up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were perfect, Lily-bug.&quot; Luke held her tight, then released her so Holly could hug her too.</p>
<p>&quot;You were amazing,&quot; Holly said, and Lily beamed.</p>
<p>Patricia appeared on stage again. &quot;Thank you all so much! Now, if the children would like to go with their parents to change, we&#39;ll be starting the dance in about fifteen minutes. Everyone&#39;s welcome to stay!&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd began to shift. Parents herded children toward the back rooms. Others headed toward the refreshment table that had been set up along one wall.</p>
<p>Lily looked up at Luke hopefully. &quot;Can I go play with my friends for a little bit? Before we have to go home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Stay where I can see you.&quot;</p>
<p>Lily ran off, and Luke found himself alone with Holly again. The room was emptying slightly as people moved around. Christmas music had started playing, softer now, festive instrumentals.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to-&quot; Holly gestured vaguely toward the refreshment table.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually,&quot; Luke said, &quot;Would you want to dance? With me?&quot;</p>
<p>Holly managed a nervous smile. &quot;I-yes. Yeah, I&#39;d like that.&quot;</p>
<p>They walked to the open space in front of the stage that served as a makeshift dance floor. A few other couples were already there, swaying gently to the music. The lights had been dimmed, strings of white Christmas lights providing a soft, romantic glow.</p>
<p>Luke took Holly&#39;s hand, his other hand settling at her waist. He could feel the satin sash under his palm, the soft velvet warm from her body. Holly&#39;s free hand rested on his shoulder, light and tentative.</p>
<p>They started to move, finding a rhythm. The dress swayed with each step, the fabric brushing against Luke&#39;s legs. Holly&#39;s hand in his was small, her berry-tipped fingers entwined with his.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not a very good dancer,&quot; Holly admitted quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re doing fine.&quot; Luke&#39;s voice came out rougher than intended. &quot;Better than fine.&quot;</p>
<p>They moved in silence for a moment, the music soft around them. Luke was intensely aware of every point of contact: her hand in his, his palm against her waist, the way she was looking up at him with those big eyes framed by dark lashes.</p>
<p>&quot;The pageant was beautiful,&quot; Holly said softly. &quot;Lily was perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Luke&#39;s throat felt tight. &quot;She was. Emily would have loved seeing that. She always said the pageant was her favorite part of the festival.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s expression softened. &quot;Tell me about her. About Emily.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke was quiet for a moment, surprised by the question. People usually avoided asking about Emily, like mentioning her would cause him pain. But Holly just looked at him with those open, understanding eyes, waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;She was so warm, so happy. Our family&#39;s rock,&quot; Luke said finally. &quot;The farm was a part of her. She grew up there, knew every tree. When we got married, taking care of it felt natural. Like we were continuing something important.&quot; He paused. &quot;After she died, I thought I could keep it going. For her. For her memory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But every day there just reminds me of what I lost. Every row of trees we planted together. Every family tradition she started.&quot; Luke&#39;s hand tightened slightly on Holly&#39;s waist. &quot;I thought I was honoring her by staying. But maybe I&#39;ve just been pretending I could keep her alive by keeping the farm.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly was quiet, just listening, just being there. It made Luke want to keep talking.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been pretending about a lot of things,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Pretending I&#39;m fine. Pretending I can handle this alone. Pretending I&#39;m not-&quot; He stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Not what?&quot; Holly&#39;s voice was gentle.</p>
<p>&quot;Not lonely. Not ready to move on. Not interested in...&quot; Luke looked down at her, at the way the Christmas lights reflected in her eyes. &quot;Not interested in feeling something real again.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s expression shifted. Something that looked almost like pain. &quot;Sometimes we pretend because we&#39;re afraid of what happens if we stop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Luke pulled her slightly closer. &quot;Exactly. But you-you make me want to stop pretending.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luke-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re genuine,&quot; Luke continued. &quot;You don&#39;t put on an act. You&#39;re just... you. You say what you think. You ask hard questions.&quot; He smiled slightly. &quot;More important, you make my daughter smile.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s face had gone pale. She looked stricken. &quot;Luke, you don&#39;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know you&#39;re leaving tomorrow,&quot; Luke said. &quot;I know this is complicated. But I can&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t feel-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are things you don&#39;t know about me.&quot; Holly&#39;s voice was tight, almost panicked. &quot;I&#39;m not-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know everything I need to know,&quot; Luke interrupted, his hand coming up to cup her face. His thumb brushed her cheek, and he felt her lean into the touch despite her words.</p>
<p>&quot;Luke, please-&quot; Holly&#39;s eyes were bright with unshed tears. &quot;You need to let me tell you-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you think you need to confess,&quot; Luke said, his voice low and intense, &quot;whatever you think will change my mind about you-it won&#39;t. I&#39;ve spent three years being afraid to feel anything. I&#39;m done being afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I-&quot;</p>
<p>Luke leaned in, slowly enough that she could pull away if she wanted.</p>
<p>She didn&#39;t pull away.</p>
<p>Their lips met. Soft at first, tentative, questioning. Holly made a small sound, her hands tightening on his shoulders. Luke pulled her closer, deepening the kiss, feeling her body against his, the velvet soft under his palms, her lips warm and sweet and perfect.</p>

<p>For a moment, everything else fell away. The crowd, the music, the complications. There was just this. Holly in his arms, kissing him back like she&#39;d been waiting for this as long as he had.</p>
<p>When they finally broke apart, both breathing harder, Luke rested his forehead against hers.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Holly&#39;s voice was panicked suddenly. She stepped back, out of his arms. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to go.&quot; Holly was backing away, her expression stricken, tears on her cheeks now. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Luke. I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Holly, wait-&quot;</p>
<p>But she was already turning, already moving toward the door. Luke started to follow, but Lily appeared at his elbow.</p>
<p>&quot;Dad, where&#39;s Holly going?&quot;</p>
<p>He watched Holly grab Emily&#39;s purple coat from a chair and disappear through the exit into the night. Snow was falling outside, visible through the windows, coming down harder now.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, Lily-bug.&quot; Luke&#39;s chest felt tight. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Mark ran.</p>
<p>The heels weren&#39;t made for running, but he couldn&#39;t stop. He burst through the community center doors into the cold night air, snow falling all around him. He fumbled with the purple coat, pulling it on as he ran toward where he&#39;d parked his car.</p>
<p>He&#39;d kissed Luke. Luke had kissed him. And it had felt right, felt perfect, felt like everything Mark hadn&#39;t known he wanted.</p>
<p>But it was built on a lie. Luke didn&#39;t know. Luke thought he was kissing Holly Marks, a woman, not Mark Holly, a man. Except Mark wasn&#39;t even sure what he was anymore, with breasts growing on his chest and his body reshaping itself and-</p>
<p>He couldn&#39;t think about it. He just needed to leave. If he stayed, he&#39;d keep changing. By tomorrow he might not be Mark at all.</p>
<p>Get in the car, drive away from Pine Hollow, away from the magic or whatever this was, away from Luke&#39;s hurt expression that was now seared into Mark&#39;s memory.</p>
<p>The rental car was parked down a side street. He fumbled with his keys, hands shaking. The velvet dress was beautiful but impractical, the skirt catching around his legs. The heels sank into the snow. The coat was warm but not warm enough for running in December.</p>
<p>He got the door open and climbed in. Started the engine. The heels made it awkward, his foot kept slipping off the pedals, the angle all wrong. He should take them off, but there wasn&#39;t time. He just pressed the gas with the pointed toe, feeling the car lurch forward as he put it in gear.</p>
<p>The tires spun on the snow-covered road. The car fishtailed slightly as he overcorrected, his heel catching on the brake.</p>
<p>He needed to be more careful. The roads were getting slick, and driving in these shoes was treacherous. But he kept his foot on the gas, turning onto the main road out of town.</p>
<p>The snow was falling heavier now, fat flakes that the wipers could barely keep up with. Visibility was dropping. Mark leaned forward, trying to see the road.</p>
<p>He should slow down. Should pull over and wait for the storm to pass.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#39;t. If he stopped, he might keep changing. If he thought about what had just happened, about Luke&#39;s lips on his, about the way his heart had felt like it might burst-</p>
<p>The car hit a patch of ice.</p>
<p>Mark felt the wheels lose traction. He tried to steer into the skid, but the car wasn&#39;t responding. It was sliding, spinning, the world a blur of white and darkness.</p>
<p>Then the sickening crunch of metal as the car left the road.</p>
<p>Everything stopped.</p>
<p>Mark sat there, breathing hard, his hands gripping the steering wheel. The engine had died. The car was tilted at an angle, nose-first in a snowdrift. Outside, the snow was falling even harder, accumulating on the windshield.</p>
<p>He tried to start the engine. Nothing. Tried again. Click, click, nothing.</p>
<p>He tried his phone. No signal. Of course no signal.</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s breath was fogging in the air. The heat had cut off with the engine. He needed to get out, flag down a car, walk back to town, something.</p>
<p>He pushed open the door and stepped out into the storm.</p>
<p>The cold hit him like a physical thing. Wind whipped around the sheer tights, snow immediately soaking through the fabric. His heels sank into the snowdrift, and he stumbled, barely catching himself on the car door.</p>
<p>He looked around. Snow. Trees. Darkness. No headlights in either direction. No houses. No lights. Just the endless white curtain of the storm and the wind howling through the trees.</p>
<p>Mark tried to walk, but the heels were useless in the snow. He made it three steps before his ankle turned and he fell hard, velvet dress soaking through, snow burning cold against his skin.</p>
<p>At least the car provided some shelter from the wind. He crawled back and pulled himself inside, slamming the door against the elements. He was shaking violently now, wet and freezing.</p>
<p>He pulled Emily&#39;s coat tighter around himself, but it wasn&#39;t enough. The cold was seeping in through the wet dress, through everything.</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s eyes grew heavy. So cold. So tired. He leaned his head back against the seat.</p>
<p>He&#39;d run away from the one place where he belonged, and now he was going to freeze to death in a ditch.</p>
<p>This was not how this was supposed to end.</p>
