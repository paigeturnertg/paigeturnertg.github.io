        <p class="drop-cap">Consciousness came to Mark slowly, then all at once.</p>
<p>Miraculously, he wasn&#39;t dead. But he also didn&#39;t know where he was. This wasn&#39;t the inn. The bed was different, the room was different, the light coming through the curtains was-</p>
<p>The crash. The snow. The car in the ditch.</p>
<p>Mark sat up slowly, his head aching slightly. He was still wearing the wine-red velvet dress from last night, now wrinkled and uncomfortable. A thick quilt had been draped over him-someone must have covered him after he&#39;d fallen asleep.</p>
<p>He was in a small bedroom with cream-colored walls and simple furniture. Through the window, he could see snow covering everything, the trees weighted down with white, deep drifts against a red barn.</p>
<p>The barn. Luke&#39;s red barn. He was at the tree farm.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>The door opened a crack, and Lily peeked in. When she saw Mark was awake, her face lit up.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly! You&#39;re awake!&quot; She pushed the door open wider. &quot;Dad! She&#39;s awake!&quot;</p>
<p>Footsteps on the stairs, and then Luke appeared in the doorway with a mug of coffee. He stopped when he saw Mark sitting up, and his expression was careful, concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Luke said softly. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-what happened? How did I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We found you,&quot; Lily said, climbing onto the edge of the bed. &quot;Dad and me. We were driving home and I saw your car in the snow and Dad stopped and you were so cold and we brought you here and-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lily, breathe,&quot; Luke said gently, but he was smiling. He came into the room and set the coffee on the nightstand. &quot;You ran off the road about two miles outside town. Lily and I were heading home from the festival when we spotted your car. You were pretty out of it-cold, in shock. I got you here and put you in the guest room.&quot; He gestured to the dress. &quot;We got you warmed up, covered you with a blanket, and let you sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s face flushed. He was acutely aware of the way his hair must look, the smeared makeup. &quot;Thank you. For rescuing me. For-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You scared us,&quot; Lily said, her voice small. &quot;We thought you were really hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Mark assured her. &quot;Just embarrassed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should be embarrassed,&quot; Luke said, but his tone was gentle. &quot;Typical city folk, driving in that storm without four wheel drive. What were you thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark couldn&#39;t meet his eyes. &quot;I- I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke was quiet for a moment. &quot;Well, you&#39;re stuck here now. Storm dropped another eight inches overnight. Roads won&#39;t be clear until tomorrow at the earliest.&quot; He paused. &quot;So it&#39;s the three of us for a while at least.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s heart jumped. Trapped here. With Luke and Lily. And if his body kept changing-</p>
<p>&quot;I should-&quot; Mark looked down at the dress. &quot;I should change. This is-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are clothes in the closet,&quot; Luke said. &quot;Emily&#39;s. You&#39;re about the same size. Wear whatever you need.&quot; He put a hand on Lily&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Come on, Lily-bug. Let&#39;s give Holly some privacy. Breakfast in twenty minutes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay! We&#39;re making pancakes! Dad lets me flip them!&quot;</p>
<p>They left, and Mark was alone with his racing thoughts and the ruined velvet dress.</p>
<p>From the closet, Mark selected a soft cream-colored cowl-neck sweater and dark leggings, grateful for something comfortable and warm. In the bathroom, he washed his face, scrubbing away last night&#39;s makeup. His reflection looked back at him: soft features, longer hair falling past his shoulders in waves of medium brown, the changes that had been happening for days now undeniable. A face that no longer needed makeup to look feminine. Which is good, because he didn&#39;t have any makeup here anyway.</p>
<p>He looked like a woman. He felt like one. The weight of the breasts under the sweater, the curve of his hips in the leggings, the way his body moved.</p>
<p>But not completely. Not where it mattered most.</p>
<p>Mark took a breath and went downstairs.</p>
<p>The kitchen was warm and bright, sunlight streaming through the windows. Lily stood on a step stool at the stove, carefully watching a pancake. Luke stood beside her, supervising, ready to catch her if she wobbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, now!&quot; Luke said, and Lily flipped the pancake with intense concentration. It landed perfectly, and she squealed with delight.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it! Did you see, Holly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw,&quot; Mark said, smiling despite everything. &quot;That was impressive.&quot;</p>
<p>They ate breakfast together. Pancakes with maple syrup, bacon, orange juice. Lily chattered about the pageant, about her friends, about how she&#39;d spotted Mark&#39;s car last night. Luke was quieter, but he kept glancing at Mark.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Luke helped Lily down from her chair. &quot;Lily-bug, why don&#39;t you go pick out which ornaments you want on the tree? Holly and I need to talk for a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay!&quot; Lily ran off to the living room.</p>
<p>Luke sat back down across from Mark, his expression serious. &quot;About last night. At the festival.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s chest tightened. He&#39;d been dreading this.</p>
<p>&quot;When I kissed you, and you ran-&quot; Luke stopped, choosing his words carefully. &quot;I need to know if I misread things. If I did something you didn&#39;t want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Mark said quickly. &quot;You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why did you leave like that?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark looked down at his coffee. &quot;It felt like starting something I couldn&#39;t finish. It wasn&#39;t fair to either of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke was quiet for a long moment. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said finally. &quot;I won&#39;t push. But Holly-&quot; He reached across the table and squeezed Mark&#39;s hand once. &quot;I meant what I said. All of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he stood. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go decorate that tree before Lily hangs all the ornaments herself.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>They spent the morning decorating. Luke brought out boxes of ornaments, each one with a story. Lily hung them on the lower branches with enthusiasm, asking Luke to lift her for the higher ones. Luke added the special pieces: glass ornaments that had been Emily&#39;s grandmother&#39;s, a star for the top that Lily insisted Mark should place.</p>
<p>As Mark stood on the step stool, reaching to position the star, he felt it. The rightness of this moment. The three of them together, creating something beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect,&quot; Luke said softly, looking up at him. And Mark wasn&#39;t sure if he meant the star or something else.</p>
<p>They took a walk outside when the sun came out briefly, Lily making snow angels while Luke showed Mark the farm covered in white, beautiful and peaceful.</p>
<p>They built a snowman in front of the barn, Lily insisting it needed a scarf and hat. Luke disappeared and returned with an old top hat and striped scarf, and Mark couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the result, slightly lopsided but charming.</p>
<p>When they came back inside, shaking snow from their coats, Lily announced she wanted to make cookies.</p>
<p>&quot;Grammy&#39;s snickerdoodles?&quot; she asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Grammy&#39;s snickerdoodles,&quot; Luke confirmed, pulling out the worn recipe card.</p>
<p>They gathered in the kitchen, Luke measuring ingredients, Mark creaming butter and sugar, Lily carefully cracking eggs with her tongue between her teeth in concentration.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to mix it exactly right,&quot; Lily explained seriously to Mark. &quot;Or they won&#39;t taste like Grammy&#39;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Mark promised.</p>
<p>Luke showed Mark how to roll the dough into balls, then roll them in cinnamon sugar. They worked together, and Mark felt the morning&#39;s tension slowly dissolving. Lily helped, her small hands working carefully, leaving floury fingerprints everywhere.</p>

<p>&quot;Dad says mom used to make these every Christmas,&quot; Lily said. &quot;He says I&#39;m good at it like she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are good at it,&quot; Mark said gently.</p>
<p>&quot;She would have liked you,&quot; Lily continued, placing another dough ball on the baking sheet. &quot;Dad&#39;s been really happy since you came to town. He smiles more. He doesn&#39;t look so sad all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s hands stilled at the counter. He glanced at Mark, something vulnerable in his expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Your dad&#39;s a good man,&quot; Mark said carefully. &quot;He&#39;s just been through a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot; Lily nodded wisely. &quot;Losing someone you love is really hard. That&#39;s what Grammy says. But she also says love doesn&#39;t go away just because someone dies. It stays with you. And there&#39;s always room for new love too.&quot;</p>
<p>Out of the mouths of babes.</p>
<p>They baked in shifts, filling the kitchen with the warm scent of cinnamon and sugar. Lily insisted on taste-testing every batch, declaring each one &quot;perfect!&quot; Luke made hot chocolate, and they sat at the kitchen table eating warm cookies and talking.</p>
<p>And slowly, sitting in that warm kitchen with flour on his hands and hot chocolate warming his chest and Lily&#39;s laughter filling the air, Mark felt his resistance crumbling.</p>
<p>This was what he wanted. All of it. The warmth, the family, the traditions, the belonging. Not just for a day or a week, but forever.</p>
<p>He wanted to wake up in this house every morning. Wanted to bake cookies with Lily every Christmas. Wanted to watch Luke smile over the breakfast table. Wanted to be part of something bigger than himself.</p>
<p>He wanted to stay.</p>
<p>But even as the realization settled into his chest, sweet and painful, Mark knew it was impossible. He couldn&#39;t stay. Because staying would mean eventually Luke would discover the truth. Would find out that Mark still was male beneath the outward changes. Would know Mark had been lying from the very first moment.</p>
<p>And Luke deserved better than that.</p>
<p>Mark excused himself to use the bathroom, and once the door was closed, he leaned against it and tried to breathe through the ache in his chest.</p>
<p>He wanted something he could never have. And that hurt more than he&#39;d imagined possible.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>They spent the rest of the early afternoon watching A Christmas Story together on the couch, Lily nestled between them providing running commentary. The movie was sweet and funny, and Mark found himself laughing despite the ache in his chest.</p>
<p>When it ended, Luke stood and stretched. &quot;I should get started on dinner. Turkey takes about four hours, so if I want it ready by seven...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re doing a whole turkey?&quot; Mark asked. &quot;For just the three of us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s tradition.&quot; Luke smiled. &quot;Christmas Eve dinner is always a bigger deal for us. We get a little dressed up, set the table properly, make it special. Emily started that, and-&quot; He stopped. &quot;Anyway. It&#39;s tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait.&quot; Mark stopped. &quot;Today is Christmas Eve?&quot;</p>
<p>Luke looked at him, confused. &quot;How hard did you hit your head last night? Of course it is. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark felt his face flush. He&#39;d been so consumed by everything-his transformation, his car crash, his feelings for Luke-that he somehow hadn&#39;t even registered that it was Christmas Eve. Which meant-</p>
<p>&quot;My article,&quot; Mark said, his voice hollow. &quot;My deadline is today.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s expression shifted. &quot;Can you write it here? The laptop&#39;s in my office. Internet&#39;s spotty because of the storm, but it should work well enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-yes. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take your time,&quot; Luke said. &quot;I&#39;ll be in the kitchen if you need anything.&quot;</p>
<p>In Luke&#39;s small office off the living room, Mark opened the laptop and stared as the cursor blinked on a blank document.</p>
<p>He&#39;d been putting this off all week, not knowing how to write it, not knowing what angle to take. But now, sitting here in Luke&#39;s house, his heart breaking with the weight of wanting something he couldn&#39;t have, Mark finally understood.</p>
<p>He understood what this place meant. What it represented. What would be lost if it disappeared.</p>
<p>Mark started typing.</p>
<p>**I came to Pine Hollow expecting a story about a quaint small-town Christmas festival. What I found instead was a story about what we risk losing when we choose convenience over connection, efficiency over authenticity, progress over preservation.**</p>
<p>The words poured out of him. Everything he&#39;d seen this week, everything he&#39;d felt, everything he&#39;d learned about what mattered and what didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>He wrote about the festival and the pageant, about families cutting their own trees and children believing in Christmas magic. He wrote about the town and its people. Sarah at the bakery, Claire at the boutique, Emma at the bookstore. About a community that depended on each other, that showed up for each other, that created something beautiful together.</p>
<p>He wrote about Luke and the farm. About a man carrying grief and duty in equal measure, about three generations of love and care poured into the land. About what it meant to honor the past while building a future.</p>
<p>He wrote about the data center that promised tax revenue and infrastructure investment but would employ only a handful of technicians while destroying the very thing that made Pine Hollow worth visiting. About how some things couldn&#39;t be measured in profit margins or quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>He wrote about finding home in unexpected places. About making the choice to stay when leaving would be easier. About recognizing that you&#39;re exactly where you&#39;re supposed to be.</p>
<p>Mark read it through again, his vision blurring. It was good. Maybe the best thing he&#39;d ever written. A love letter to a life he couldn&#39;t have.</p>
<p>&quot;Dinner in fifteen minutes!&quot; Luke called from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Mark hit save and closed the laptop. He&#39;d send it after dinner. Right now, he needed to get changed.</p>
<p>He went upstairs to find something appropriate for the Shepherds&#39; Christmas Eve dinner.</p>
<p>He found it near the back of the guest room closet among Emily&#39;s clothes: a dress in pure white silk with a subtle sheen. Long sleeves, modest neckline, delicate pleating across the bodice. The skirt fell to just below the knee in soft, fluid lines. Simple but elegant. Perfect.</p>
<p>Luke had set the dining room table with fine china and crystal, white candles glowing in silver holders. He&#39;d changed into a dark suit with a burgundy tie. Lily wore a red velvet dress, her hair in careful braids.</p>
<p>&quot;You look like an angel!&quot; Lily declared when she saw Mark on the stairs.</p>
<p>Luke looked up and smiled. &quot;You look beautiful,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Really beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat down to the meal Luke had prepared, turkey and all the traditional fixings. Lily chattered happily about Christmas, about what she hoped Santa would bring, about how this was &quot;the best Christmas Eve ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke and Mark talked too, less guarded now than they&#39;d been that morning. Luke talked about Christmases past, about traditions and memories. He told stories about Emily, his voice warm with remembrance rather than pain. Mark listened and asked questions, and felt his heart breaking a little more with each passing minute.</p>
<p>This-this right here-was what he wanted. This family, this warmth, this belonging.</p>
<p>And tomorrow it would be over.</p>
<p>After dinner, they moved to the living room. Luke started White Christmas, and they watched it together on the couch, Lily between them. The movie was sweet and romantic, full of hope and happy endings.</p>
<p>When it ended, Lily was fighting sleep despite her best efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Bedtime, Lily-bug,&quot; Luke said gently. &quot;Santa can&#39;t come until you&#39;re asleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#39;m not tired,&quot; Lily protested, though her drooping eyes said otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; Luke scooped her up. &quot;Let&#39;s get you into your pajamas.&quot;</p>
<p>He carried her upstairs, and Mark stood, starting to clear the coffee table.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Luke came back downstairs. Mark had moved to the kitchen and was rinsing dishes at the sink.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to do that,&quot; Luke said.</p>
<p>&quot;You cooked this whole meal yourself,&quot; Mark said without turning around. &quot;The least I can do is clean up. Go sit down. Relax.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke hesitated, then went into the living room. Mark heard the couch creak as he sat down.</p>
<p>Mark took his time with the dishes, letting the warm water run over his hands, focusing on the simple task. Not thinking about tomorrow. Not thinking about leaving. Just being here, in this moment, in this kitchen, in this life.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Mark finished drying the last dish and set it in the rack. The kitchen was clean, the dinner mess dealt with. He dried his hands on a towel and headed back to the living room.</p>
<p>He found Luke on the couch, laptop open, tears streaming down his face.</p>
<p>Mark froze in the doorway. &quot;Luke?&quot;</p>
<p>Luke looked up, quickly wiping at his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have-the laptop was there and I opened it and your article was right there and I-&quot; He stopped, took a breath. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I know I shouldn&#39;t have read it without asking.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s heart stopped. &quot;I-it&#39;s not finished. I was going to read it over again before-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s perfect.&quot; Luke&#39;s voice was rough. &quot;Holly, it&#39;s perfect. You&#39;re right. About everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luke-&quot;</p>
<p>He stood, setting the laptop aside. &quot;I&#39;ve been so focused on running away from the pain that I couldn&#39;t see what I&#39;d be running away from. The good things. The things that matter.&quot; He crossed to her. &quot;You made me see it clearly. You gave me that gift.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just wrote what I saw-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t leave this place. I&#39;m keeping the farm.&quot; The words came out strong, certain. &quot;I&#39;m not selling. I&#39;m staying.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;Luke, that&#39;s-that&#39;s wonderful-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay with me.&quot; Luke took her hands in his. &quot;I know it&#39;s fast. I know it&#39;s crazy. But stay, Holly. Make a life here. With me. With Lily. We could-we could build something together. A future.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s heart stopped. This was it. The offer of everything he wanted.</p>
<p>And he had to say no.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Mark whispered.</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s expression faltered. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My life is in LA. My job, everything I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bring it here. Or start over. I don&#39;t care.&quot; Luke&#39;s grip on his hands tightened. &quot;Holly, didn&#39;t you feel it today? Baking cookies with Lily? Decorating the tree? Being part of this family? I know you felt it. I saw it in your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did,&quot; Mark said, his voice breaking. &quot;I do. But I can&#39;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Luke&#39;s voice rose slightly. &quot;Just tell me why. Is it me? Is there someone in LA? What am I missing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not you-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what?&quot; Luke demanded. &quot;You wrote that article. You see what this place means, what it could be. You see us. So why are you walking away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I&#39;m not-&quot; Mark stopped, the truth caught in his throat. &quot;I&#39;m not who you think I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It means-&quot; Mark pulled his hands away. &quot;It means I can&#39;t stay. Please don&#39;t ask me to explain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t ask you to explain?&quot; Luke&#39;s voice was louder now, frustration breaking through. &quot;Holly, I&#39;m laying everything out here. And you won&#39;t even tell me why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mark said, tears streaming down his face. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not an answer!&quot; Luke&#39;s voice echoed in the room. &quot;Why won&#39;t you just TELL me what&#39;s going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you&#39;d hate me!&quot; The words tore out of Mark before he could stop them. &quot;Because if you knew-&quot; He stopped, covering his mouth.</p>
<p>Luke stared at him, his expression cycling through anger and hurt and confusion. His jaw worked like he was trying to find words, trying to understand. &quot;I let you into my home, into my daughter&#39;s life. Into my heart.&quot; His voice cracked. &quot;And you won&#39;t even trust me with whatever this is?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s tears fell harder. &quot;Luke-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought-&quot; Luke stopped, running a hand through his hair. &quot;I thought we had something real. I thought you felt what I felt.&quot; He laughed, a bitter sound. &quot;God, I&#39;m an idiot. I read your article and thought you understood. Thought you saw me, saw this place, saw what we could build together.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood there in silence, the air heavy with everything unsaid.</p>
<p>Luke finally shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t understand this. Any of this. But I&#39;m not going to beg. We&#39;ll call a tow truck for your car first thing tomorrow and I&#39;ll give you a ride back into town.&quot; His voice was quiet now, defeated. &quot;I hope you find whatever it is you&#39;re looking for in LA, Holly. I really do.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned and went upstairs. Mark heard the bedroom door close.</p>
<p>Mark stood alone in the living room, tears streaming down his face, his whole body shaking. He&#39;d ruined everything. Tomorrow the roads would clear and he&#39;d have to leave and Luke would never know-</p>
<p>He sank onto the couch, burying his face in his hands. The article was still on the laptop screen, words about home and belonging and having the courage to stay. Words he&#39;d written but couldn&#39;t live. He couldn&#39;t be Holly forever. Eventually Luke would expect the intimacy Mark couldn't give him, the deception would unravel, and when it did, Luke's hurt would be so much worse. </p>
<p>Better to leave now. Better to-</p>
<p>A small sound made him turn.</p>
<p>Lily stood in the hallway in her pajamas, her eyes wide and scared.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly? Why are you crying? Why was Dad yelling?&quot;</p>
<p>Mark quickly wiped at his face, but the tears kept coming. &quot;It&#39;s just a grown-up argument. Nothing for you to worry about.&quot; He tried to smile. &quot;Let&#39;s get you back to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you read me a story?&quot; Lily asked. &quot;Dad usually does but he seems upset.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s heart clenched. &quot;Of course. Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>He followed Lily upstairs to her bedroom, a cozy space with a pink comforter and shelves full of books and toys. Lily climbed into bed and handed Mark a picture book about angels.</p>
<p>He sat on the edge of the bed and read it slowly, his voice occasionally catching. The story was about an angel who felt different from the others, who didn&#39;t think she belonged, until she found the people who needed her most.</p>
<p>When he finished, Lily&#39;s eyes were drowsy.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly?&quot; Lily murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sweetheart?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark&#39;s vision blurred. &quot;I love you too, Lily. So much.&quot;</p>
<p>He sat there until Lily drifted off to sleep, her small hand still clutching his. As he sat there in the darkness, watching her breathe, Mark felt something bloom in his chest. Warmth. Not metaphorical, actual physical warmth, spreading from his heart outward like water flowing through channels.</p>
<p>He carefully extracted his hand from Lily&#39;s and stood, the warmth intensifying. It radiated down his arms, through his torso, pooling lower.</p>
<p>Mark left the room quietly and made it back to the guest room before the warmth concentrated, focusing between his legs with an intensity that made him gasp.</p>
<p>The warmth built and built, a pressure that was almost unbearable, and then-</p>
<p>It was gone.</p>
<p>Mark lifted the white dress with shaking hands. He reached under the waistband of his panties, and felt-</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing male, at least. Just smoothness, a small tuft of brown hair, and soft folds.</p>
<p>The transformation was complete.</p>
<p>Mark-Holly-stared at her reflection, waiting for panic or fear or regret.</p>
<p>Instead, she felt relief. Wholeness. Peace.</p>
<p>She went to the laptop and opened it with trembling hands. She pulled up the article, read it through one more time, then hit send.</p>
<p>Then she opened a new email and started typing.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Karen-&quot;</p>
<p>Holly&#39;s fingers hovered over the keyboard as she took a deep breath. Then she kept typing, the words coming easily now. When she finished, she read it over once, then hit send before she could second-guess herself.</p>
<p>Done. It was done.</p>
<p>She opened the top drawer of the guest room dresser and let her hand brush across the fabrics - silk, satin, soft cotton. Everything felt different now, more vivid. The textures registered against her fingertips with an intensity she&#39;d never experienced before, sending little shivers up her arm. Her senses felt heightened, awakened, as if her new body was more attuned to sensation than her old one had ever been.</p>
<p>A smile crossed her lips as she made her selection.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Holly took a breath and opened her bedroom door, padding down the hallway to Luke&#39;s room. Light showed under the door. She pushed it open quietly.</p>
<p>She found Luke on the edge of the bed shirtless, dressed only in flannel pajama pants, his head in his hands. When he looked up and saw her, his expression shifted from exhaustion to confusion to something else entirely.</p>
<p>Holly stood in the doorway wearing a deep blue silk nightgown, thin straps barely clinging to her shoulders, lace trim at mid-thigh. Her hair fell loose around her shoulders. Her face was flushed.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>&quot;Holly. What are you-&quot;</p>
<p>Holly crossed the room, leaned against the bed between Luke&#39;s legs, her hands on his bare shoulders. &quot;I quit my job,&quot; she said, her voice steady despite her racing heart. &quot;I sent my resignation tonight. I&#39;m not going back to LA.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke stared at her. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m staying,&quot; Holly said, looking directly into his eyes. &quot;Here. In Pine Hollow. With you. With Lily. If you&#39;ll still have me.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s expression cycled through disbelief, hope, fear. &quot;But you said-downstairs, you said-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was scared.&quot; Holly took his hands in hers. &quot;I was terrified. Of what staying would mean. Of letting myself have something I wanted this much. Of-&quot; She stopped. &quot;Of a lot of things. But after you left, Lily woke up. She heard us fighting. And she told me something that made everything clear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did she say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She said she loved me.&quot; Holly&#39;s eyes glistened with tears. &quot;And I love her. I love you, Luke. I love Lily. I love this farm and this town and this life. And I&#39;m not leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke pulled her into his arms so suddenly she gasped, holding her so tight she could barely breathe. She felt him shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I&#39;d lost you,&quot; Luke said against her hair. &quot;I thought-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t lose me. You&#39;ll never lose me.&quot; Holly pulled back just enough to look up at him. &quot;I&#39;m home, Luke. Finally, completely home.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s hands came up to cup her face, his thumbs brushing away her tears. &quot;I love you,&quot; he whispered. &quot;God, Holly, I love you so much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he kissed her, desperate, grateful, full of relief and joy and promise. Holly kissed back, her hands circling his neck, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s hands moved to the thin straps of the nightgown, his touch gentle, questioning. Holly nodded, and he slid them down her shoulders. The silk pooled at her waist.</p>
<p>He looked at her with such tenderness, such desire, that Holly felt as if she couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Luke murmured, his hands moving over her breasts, and Holly gasped at the sensation. Overwhelming, perfect, real.</p>
<p>They moved together on the bed, and Luke was careful, attentive. His hands explored Holly&#39;s body. The narrow waist, the curve of her hips, the softness of her skin. Every touch made Holly feel more present, more whole, more herself than she&#39;d ever felt.</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s lips traced down her neck, across her collarbone, lower. His touch was reverent on her breasts, her stomach, everywhere. When his hand moved between her thighs, Holly arched into it, her fingers digging into his shoulders.</p>
<p>This body was different-more sensitive, the pleasure building and spreading in waves that made her dizzy. She&#39;d never felt anything like this before.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this okay?&quot; Luke whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. God, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Luke moved over her, his weight settling between her thighs. His hands slid down her sides, over her hips, gently parting her legs wider. She could feel him against her new entrance, hard and insistent, and her body responded with wetness, inviting him in.</p>
<p>When he entered her, Holly gasped, not from pain but from the overwhelming rightness of it. The sensation was overwhelming. A slow, inexorable fullness as he pushed inside. Her body stretched to accommodate him, yielding to him, surrounding him. There was pressure, intensity, a feeling of being filled that made her eyes water.</p>
<p>This was real. She was really a woman. Completely, fully, undeniably. The tears that fell weren&#39;t from sadness but from relief, from joy, from finally being whole.</p>
<p>Luke kissed her tears away and began to move. Slowly at first, each stroke sending sensation radiating through her body. Not just where they were joined but everywhere, up her spine, through her breasts, making her entire being feel electrified and new.</p>
<p>She wrapped her legs around him, and the angle shifted. Suddenly every thrust hit something inside her that made her cry out.</p>
<p>&quot;There?&quot; Luke asked softly, and did it again.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. God, yes. Right there.&quot;</p>
<p>They found their rhythm, bodies moving together, and the pleasure built in waves unlike anything Holly had known before. In her old body, pleasure had been sharp, finite, localized. This was oceanic. Deep and consuming, building through her whole self.</p>
<p>Luke&#39;s hand found her breast, and the dual sensations made Holly moan. Her hand slipped between their bodies, finding where she was most sensitive.</p>
<p>When the orgasm came, it swept through her like a tide, her body clenching around him in rhythmic pulses as pleasure crashed through her in surges that seemed endless. She heard herself crying his name, felt Luke shudder and groan as he came with her, the two of them holding each other through it.</p>
<p>After, they lay tangled together, both breathing hard. Luke was still inside her, and Holly could feel the gradual softening, the slow slip of him from her body. It felt like a loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Luke asked, brushing hair from her face.</p>
<p>Holly laughed, the sound watery with tears. &quot;I&#39;m more than okay. I&#39;m-&quot; She stopped, overwhelmed. &quot;That was incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Luke agreed, kissing her softly. &quot;It really was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re really staying,&quot; Luke murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t believe it either,&quot; Holly admitted. &quot;But I am. This is where I belong.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside, the world was quiet and white. Inside, Holly felt warm and safe and exactly where she was meant to be.</p>
<p>She wasn&#39;t running anymore.</p>
<p>She was home.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p><em>Epilogue: One Year Later</em></p>
<p>Holly stood at the window of the Pine Hollow Gazette&#39;s small office, watching the snow fall on Main Street. Outside, the town was alive with Christmas Eve energy. More families than she&#39;d ever seen, people carrying packages from the boutiques, clusters of tourists taking photos in front of the decorated storefronts.</p>
<p>Pine Hollow had been saved. And Holly got to write about it every week.</p>
<p>She rested one hand on her rounded belly, feeling their daughter flutter and shift. Five months pregnant, and she&#39;d never felt more beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly?&quot; A deep voice called from the doorway.</p>
<p>She turned to see Luke and Lily standing there, both bundled in winter coats and grinning. Lily held a thermos.</p>
<p>&quot;We brought you hot chocolate!&quot; Lily announced. &quot;Dad said you&#39;ve been working all day and need a break.&quot;</p>
<p>Holly smiled. &quot;You&#39;re not wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark Holly&#39;s Pine Hollow article from last year had won an award and been picked up nationally. The attention had brought visitors to the town. People who wanted to experience the authentic Christmas tradition he&#39;d written about. The farm had thrived. And so had every business on Main Street.</p>
<p>Nobody ever noticed that Mark Holly never wrote another article.</p>
<p>Holly Marks had taken over as editor of the Gazette six months ago, when old Mr. Nichols finally retired. Every week she got to write about the people and places she loved, to be the voice of a community that had become hers.</p>
<p>&quot;Ready to go?&quot; Luke asked, crossing to help her with her coat.</p>
<p>She shook her head. No coat. She was always running hot at this stage of the pregnancy and the forest green sweater dress would be enough to keep her warm. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To see the tree!&quot; Lily said. &quot;Everyone&#39;s gathering in the square for the end of the festival. We can&#39;t miss it!&quot;</p>
<p>Holly gathered her things and pulled on a cream beret over her warm golden brown hair tied in a loose braid. Her wedding ring-a simple gold band engraved with holly leaves-glinted in the light as she took Luke&#39;s offered hand.</p>
<p>They stepped out onto Main Street together, and Holly breathed in the cold air, the scent of pine and cinnamon and snow. Luke&#39;s arm went around her waist, careful of her belly. Lily held her other hand.</p>
<p>They walked slowly through town, and Holly saw it all with fresh eyes. The families who&#39;d come from neighboring towns just to experience Pine Hollow&#39;s Christmas. The storefronts that were thriving instead of struggling. The life that had returned to this place.</p>
<p>All because Luke had chosen to stay. All because they&#39;d chosen each other. All because Pine Hollow had changed her.</p>
<p>&quot;Holly! Luke!&quot; Emma called from outside the bookstore. Inside, Jessica was busy arranging a display of Christmas novels in the window.</p>
<p>They walked over. Emma&#39;s eyes went to Holly&#39;s belly and she smiled. &quot;Looking radiant as always.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Emma&#39;s gaze met Holly&#39;s, and something knowing passed between them. They had never again discussed that first day, the cocoa spill, any of it. But sometimes Holly caught Emma looking at her with a gentle, knowing expression.</p>
<p>Like she understood. Like maybe she&#39;d seen this before. Holly glanced inside the bookstore, where Jessica was laughing at something with a customer, and wondered.</p>
<p>Emma gave her a small wink and smiled at Luke. &quot;Nice job on the town tree. It&#39;s a beautiful one this year.&quot;</p>
<p>They continued on toward the town square, where a crowd was already gathering. In the center stood the Christmas tree. Massive, perfectly shaped, its branches heavy with lights.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s from our farm,&quot; Lily announced proudly to a family standing nearby. &quot;My dad grew that tree.&quot;</p>
<p>The family smiled, and Holly&#39;s chest felt warm with love and pride.</p>
<p>They found a spot near the front, and Holly looked up at the tree. This tree that Luke had grown, that represented everything they&#39;d fought to preserve. In a few minutes, the mayor would address the crowd, officially closing the festival and sending everyone home to their families for Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Luke&#39;s arm tightened around her waist. &quot;You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Holly looked at the tree towering above them, then at the families gathered around. Some local, some visitors, all here because of the tradition that had almost been lost. She looked at Lily, who was chattering excitedly to anyone who would listen. She felt their daughter moving inside her, ready to become part of this story.</p>
<p>And she looked at Luke, this man who&#39;d taught her what it meant to be brave enough to stay, to choose love over fear, to build a life instead of running from one.</p>
<p>She thought about Mark, that lonely journalist who&#39;d arrived here a year ago, cynical and disconnected, not knowing he was looking for home. He&#39;d come to Pine Hollow to write a story he didn&#39;t want to write about a quaint small-town Christmas.</p>
<p>And she&#39;d found everything she never knew she wanted.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; Holly said, and meant it with every part of herself.</p>
<p>She was Holly Marks Shepherd. Editor. Wife. Mother-to-be.</p>
<p>She was exactly where she was meant to be.</p>
<p>And she was never leaving.</p>
<p><em>THE END</em></p>

<p><em>Author's Note</em></p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
<p>&quot;Miss-ing You This Christmas&quot; started with a suggestion from Alanawriter: what if someone wrote a Hallmark Christmas movie... but with a TG twist? I couldn&#39;t resist. Hallmark movies have their own delightful formula-small towns, widowers with precocious kids, big city cynics who discover what really matters, Christmas magic that fixes everything. They&#39;re comfort food, and I wanted to see what happened when you added body transformation and gender identity to that mix.</p>
<p>This story let me play with something I don&#39;t usually do: genuine sweetness. My previous work has leaned into darkness, manipulation, and moral ambiguity. But there&#39;s something powerful about writing a story where the transformation isn&#39;t a punishment or a trap-it&#39;s a gift. Where the magic doesn&#39;t destroy the protagonist but helps them discover who they were meant to be. Where &quot;living a Hallmark movie&quot; becomes literal in the best possible way.</p>
<p>The challenge was balancing Hallmark wholesomeness with the kind of substantive TG content and character development that this genre deserves. I wanted the Christmas magic and the small-town romance, but I also wanted the body horror of waking up changed, the panic of being trapped in a role, the genuine emotional journey of accepting a new identity. Mark/Holly&#39;s transformation needed to feel earned, not just convenient.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this festive departure from my usual tone. Sometimes we all need a story where everything works out, where love wins, where Christmas magic is real and kind.</p>
