        <p class="drop-cap">&quot;Tonight, at 8pm, the season premiere of &#39;The Tates&#39;! Two brothers, one inheritance, and a house full of memories they&#39;d both rather forget. Watch what happens when Alex, the bitter ad executive with two ex-wives bleeding him dry-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad. Cut it out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-moves in with Brad, the award-winning journalist turned blogger-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad! Stop. Narrating. Our. Lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad Tate dropped the announcer voice. &quot;I&#39;m just setting the scene.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is real life, Brad. Real people. Real problems. Not a goddamn sitcom.&quot; Alex Tate stood in the doorway of their late parents&#39; living room wearing what an advertising creative director probably shouldn&#39;t wear to work: a wrinkled dress shirt that had given up somewhere around the third wearing, slacks that were fighting a losing battle against his midsection, and the general air of someone who&#39;d stopped trying to impress clients around the same time his second marriage ended.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re literally moving in together after our parents died,&quot; Brad said, gesturing with what might have once been a protein bar but was now mostly wrapper. &quot;That&#39;s the setup of every roommate sitcom ever made. I&#39;m Oscar, you&#39;re Felix-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not The Odd Couple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s exactly The Odd Couple. You&#39;re uptight, I&#39;m relaxed. You&#39;re neurotic, I&#39;m-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slovenly? Sedentary? Stuck rewatching old sitcoms to avoid thinking about Hannah?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad winced. That one hit a little close. He&#39;d been &quot;working on his blog&quot; for three years now, ever since the Tribune had laid him off along with half the newsroom. The blog was about classic sitcoms and their cultural impact. It had seventeen regular readers.</p>
<p>&quot;See? You&#39;re already doing the Felix thing.&quot; Brad settled onto the couch, which exhaled a small cloud of dust and defeat. &quot;Give it two weeks and you&#39;ll be following me around with a vacuum cleaner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In two weeks, we&#39;ll have sold this place and gone our separate ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are you moving in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you&#39;re moving in. I&#39;m not letting you have the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Neither do I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you can&#39;t have it.&quot;</p>
<p>They stared at each other across the living room, which looked less like a home and more like a museum dedicated to the 1970s-specifically, the parts of the 1970s that even the 1970s were embarrassed about. Wood paneling the color of depression. Avocado green shag carpeting that had probably been white once, in theory. Furniture in earth tones that suggested the earth in question had given up and died. And there, hanging near the doorway like a textile nightmare, was an actual macram&eacute; owl. Their mother had loved that owl. Their mother had been wrong about the owl.</p>
<p>Brad swept his arm around the room with the enthusiasm of a game show host revealing a booby prize. &quot;Look at this place! It&#39;s like walking onto a sitcom set. Three&#39;s Company meets The Brady Bunch meets a thrift store having an existential crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you be serious for five minutes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tried that once. Didn&#39;t care for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth was grimmer than Brad&#39;s admission suggested, but only slightly.</p>
<p>The truth was that since Hannah died, Brad had been living inside classic sitcoms the way some people lived inside bottles. The plots were predictable. The conflicts resolved cleanly. Nobody got cancer. And if they did, it was a &quot;very special episode&quot; that ended with a hug and a lesson learned, not eighteen months of watching someone disappear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, real life didn&#39;t care about Brad&#39;s coping mechanisms. Real life had bills and inheritance law and a brother he could barely tolerate.</p>
<p>Neither brother wanted to move in with the other. But neither of them could afford to buy out the other&#39;s fifty percent share.</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s salary as a creative director at McMann & Tate would have been plenty-he was good at his job, even if he&#39;d stopped caring about looking the part-but he was hemorrhaging money in alimony. Two ex-wives, two monthly checks, both of them living off his income like he was running a charity for divorced women.</p>
<p>He&#39;d tried everything to minimize the payments. Better lawyers. Loopholes. Arguments about how they were perfectly capable of supporting themselves if they just got off their asses and got jobs instead of depending on him to maintain their &quot;accustomed lifestyle.&quot; But family court had disagreed.</p>
<p>&quot;They could support themselves if they wanted to,&quot; he&#39;d told his second divorce lawyer. &quot;They&#39;re just lazy. They got comfortable depending on me, and now I&#39;m stuck paying for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer had made a note and said nothing.</p>
<p>Brad made decent money too-or he had, back when newspapers existed as going concerns rather than elaborate suicide notes to journalism. Now he made whatever you could make from a blog with seventeen readers and the occasional freelance piece about &quot;10 Classic Sitcoms That Predicted Modern Life&quot; that paid forty-seven dollars and required two rounds of edits.</p>
<p>He&#39;d been coasting for three years, telling himself he was &quot;building his brand&quot; and &quot;establishing his voice&quot; when really he was watching Cheers and trying not to think about how Hannah used to make fun of his sitcom obsession right up until the cancer made it impossible for her to make fun of anything.</p>
<p>The real estate market was, to use the technical term, dogshit. The house needed work. The roof leaked. The electrical was from an era when people thought asbestos was a feature. And something was wrong with the foundation that made contractors suck air through their teeth before saying &quot;well, it&#39;s not technically condemned.&quot;</p>
<p>They were stuck with each other. In this house. In 1974, apparently, based on the d&eacute;cor.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll take the master bedroom,&quot; Alex announced, as if he&#39;d just claimed the last seat on a lifeboat.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll take the guest room.&quot; Brad didn&#39;t mention that the guest room was closer to the kitchen and the good TV. Let Alex have his victory.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>&quot;And so begins the cohabitation phase of our story. Two brothers, divided by rivalry, united by-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop narrating,&quot; Alex muttered as he carried a box past Brad three days later. Move-in day was already off to a rocky start.</p>
<p>&quot;You know,&quot; Brad said, &quot;you&#39;re getting that vein in your forehead. The one you always get when you&#39;re about to lecture me.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex shifted his box. &quot;At least I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s been wearing the same Cheers t-shirt for three days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There it is. Also, it&#39;s a different Cheers t-shirt. I have seven of them. It&#39;s called a wardrobe system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s called you haven&#39;t done laundry since 2022.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s-&quot; Brad paused. &quot;Actually that might be accurate.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood in the hallway, boxes in arms, falling into the old tit-for-tat rhythm they&#39;d established somewhere around age eight and never quite broken. Brad takes a shot, Alex fires back, Brad counters, Alex responds. The bickering was almost comfortable. Familiar. Like putting on an old jacket that didn&#39;t fit anymore but you couldn&#39;t quite throw away.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re doing it again,&quot; Alex said after a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Doing what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The thing. The brother thing. Where we snipe at each other until one of us says something that actually hurts and then we don&#39;t talk for six months.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad shifted his box. &quot;We made it, what, ten minutes this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New record.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we need rules,&quot; Brad said. &quot;Structure. A framework to prevent the inevitable spiral into fratricide.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood there for another moment, both knowing this was a terrible idea, both knowing they were going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Alex said. &quot;I&#39;ll find a roommate agreement. Something official. Legal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something that will keep us from killing each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or at least delay it until after we sell the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pulled out his phone and started scrolling. &quot;Here. Same site I got my prenups from. Very thorough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How&#39;d those work out for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prenups worked fine. The marriages were the problem.&quot; Alex kept scrolling. &quot;I got screwed anyway, but at least the prenups limited the damage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit. Real romantic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Romance is for people who haven&#39;t been divorced twice.&quot; Alex found what he was looking for and shoved his phone at Brad. &quot;Just sign it.&quot;</p>
<p>The screen showed a PDF titled &quot;Roommate Dispute Resolution Agreement&quot; with a clipart image of two people shaking hands in front of a house. Forty-seven pages of dense legal text in what appeared to be 8-point font, single-spaced, the kind of document designed to make your eyes glaze over somewhere around paragraph two.</p>
<p>Brad scrolled through it for approximately thirty seconds-long enough to see words like &quot;heretofore&quot; and &quot;party of the first part&quot; and &quot;remediation procedures&quot;-before his brain declared bankruptcy and he scrawled his signature with his finger.</p>
<p>&quot;There. Happy?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex took the phone back, added his own signature without reading any more than Brad had, and hit submit. &quot;Ecstatic. Now we have rules. Structure. A framework for cohabitation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have a binding agreement neither of us read.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to adulthood.&quot;</p>
<p>The contract activated with no fanfare. No notification. No acknowledgment. Just a subtle shift in the air, like the house had been holding its breath and finally exhaled.</p>
<p>Or maybe that was just the foundation settling. Hard to tell with a house this old.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The brothers actually made it a week without getting into an argument. Mostly by avoiding each other completely. Different meal times. Different bathroom schedules. Careful choreography to minimize contact. It almost worked.</p>
<p>Then Louise Walsh showed up.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang at 6:47pm. Brad and Alex both looked up from their respective corners of the common room-Brad on the couch with his laptop open to his blog (current post: &quot;Why Three&#39;s Company Secretly Explained Late-Stage Capitalism,&quot; current readers: zero), Alex at the dining room table with storyboards for tomorrow&#39;s pitch meeting spread out.</p>
<p>They looked at the door. Then at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You get it,&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s your house too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m busy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m also busy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re blogging. That&#39;s not busy. That&#39;s procrastination with a URL.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Brad could respond with something cutting about advertising being propaganda for capitalism, the door opened.</p>
<p>Louise Walsh didn&#39;t wait for invitations. She never had, not in the thirty years she&#39;d lived next door and appointed herself the neighborhood&#39;s unofficial mayor, conscience, and gossip clearinghouse. She walked in carrying a casserole dish covered in aluminum foil, her short gray hair perfectly curled.</p>
<p>At sixty-something, she had the energy of someone half her age and the opinions of someone who&#39;d seen everything twice and had thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Boys!&quot; She set the casserole on the coffee table without asking, right on top of the TV Guide from 1987 that their father had kept for reasons known only to him and possibly God. &quot;I saw the cars and knew you&#39;d moved in! I&#39;ve been dying to come over but I didn&#39;t want to intrude too soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad and Alex stared in silence, neither quite sure how to respond to this cheerful invasion.</p>
<p>Louise surveyed the room with the keen eye of someone conducting a home inspection. &quot;Now, I know you boys are probably eating terribly-bachelors always do-so I made you my famous tuna casserole.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad looked at the casserole with barely concealed horror. He could see chunks of something gray suspended in beige sauce, topped with potato chips that had gone soggy from condensation. It looked like something that had died and then been reanimated through dark magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Brad, honey-how&#39;s the writing going? Are you working on anything?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt his face flush. &quot;I&#39;m working on my blog. It&#39;s about-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t work,&quot; Alex cut in, the words coming out sharper than he probably intended. A week of careful silence had left him with no filter. &quot;He just sits on the couch all day watching TV. He doesn&#39;t even exercise. Just sits there.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s jaw tightened. &quot;At least I&#39;m not-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you, Alex,&quot; Louise pivoted, &quot;you look so stressed. All those lines in your face. Are you taking care of yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He works himself to death,&quot; Brad said, the resentment pouring out in retaliation. &quot;He&#39;s always working. Never relaxes. Never stops. It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to have a heart attack by forty-six.&quot;</p>

<p>They glared at each other across Louise&#39;s perfectly curled head. She looked between them, smiled pleasantly, and headed for the door.</p>
<p>&quot;You boys take care now. I&#39;ll check in again soon.&quot;</p>
<p>She left before either of them could respond, pulling the door shut behind her with a decisive click that somehow sounded like judgment. Alex picked up the casserole dish like it might explode and headed toward the kitchen, already trying to figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p>Brad stared at the closed door for a long moment. &quot;Classic Nosy Neighbor trope. She&#39;s going to insert herself into our lives at regular intervals and offer unsolicited advice that somehow always turns out to be plot-relevant. Mrs. Kravitz from Bewitched. Wilson from Home Improvement. Kimmy Gibbler from Full House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s just a person, Brad!&quot; Alex shouted from the kitchen.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Brad&#39;s eyes opened at six the next morning.</p>
<p>This was wrong on multiple levels. Brad didn&#39;t wake up at 6:00am. Brad didn&#39;t wake up before noon if he could help it. His entire lifestyle for the past three years had been built around the principle that morning people were suspiciously cheerful and probably up to something.</p>
<p>But his eyes opened at 6:00am and his body felt restless. Like it wanted to do something. Like it expected him to move.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t even exercise. Just sits there.&quot; Alex&#39;s voice from the night before echoed in his head.</p>
<p>Brad lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about his routine. Wake up late. Check his blog stats (depressing). Watch Cheers. Eat something. Watch The Odd Couple. Work a bit more. Watch Three&#39;s Company. Go to bed. Repeat.</p>
<p>He&#39;d been doing it for three years. Since Hannah died. Since the Tribune laid him off. Since the world stopped making sense and the only thing that felt manageable was the couch and the TV and the same jokes he&#39;d heard a thousand times.</p>
<p>Brad got up. This felt wrong, like he was betraying some fundamental principle. He dug through his unpacked boxes until he found a pair old sneakers. They felt weird. He couldn&#39;t remember the last time he&#39;d worn actual shoes.</p>
<p>He went outside.</p>
<p>The morning air was cool and aggressively cheerful. Birds were singing like they had something to prove. The sun was doing that thing where it painted the sky in pastels, which felt unnecessary and show-offy. Brad started walking. Not running-he wasn&#39;t that ambitious yet-but a brisk walk around the block.</p>
<p>His legs protested. His lungs burned. His body filed several formal complaints about this sudden and unwelcome development in their relationship.</p>
<p>But by the time he got back to the house twenty minutes later, sweating and out of breath and slightly dizzy, he felt something he hadn&#39;t felt in three years.</p>
<p>Awake.</p>
<p>He stood in the driveway, hands on his knees, breathing hard. That wasn&#39;t so bad, he thought. Maybe I could do that again tomorrow. Maybe this is just me making a healthy choice. Maybe Alex is right and I have been sitting around too much.</p>
<p>That afternoon, he googled &quot;gyms near me&quot; and found a 24-hour fitness place three blocks away. Month-to-month membership, no contract, lots of machines he didn&#39;t know how to use. He signed up online, telling himself he probably wouldn&#39;t go more than once or twice, but at least it was something.</p>
<p>At least it was progress.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>That same morning, Alex&#39;s alarm went off at 6:00am like it had every day for twenty years. He stared at it, finger hovering over the screen.</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s complaint echoed in his mind. &quot;He&#39;s always working. Never relaxes.&quot;</p>
<p>The Anderson campaign was behind schedule. The client was getting impatient. His boss had sent three emails yesterday marked URGENT in the subject line, which was his boss&#39;s way of saying &quot;I&#39;m panicking and now you get to panic too.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex should get up. Should shower. Should get to the office early to catch up.</p>
<p>He turned off the alarm and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>When he finally woke at 9:30am, he felt disoriented, like he&#39;d overslept for an important meeting. But also... relaxed. Rested. He picked up his phone to check his work email-four new messages from his boss, two from the client, one from his assistant asking if he was okay-and found himself responding that he was taking a sick day.</p>
<p>&quot;It can wait.&quot;</p>
<p>The thought felt foreign, like someone else had put it in his head. Alex didn&#39;t let things wait. Alex was the guy who answered emails at midnight. Who worked weekends. Who took his laptop on vacation except he never went on vacation because someone had to keep things running.</p>
<p>But today, he stayed home. Made coffee. Sat on the ugly orange couch his parents had owned since Nixon was president and read a book he&#39;d been meaning to read for five years. When his phone rang with calls from work, he declined them. When emails came through marked URGENT, he skimmed them and decided they weren&#39;t actually urgent at all. Everything was urgent to his boss. Very little was actually urgent to reality.</p>
<p>By evening, he felt lighter. Less tense. Like someone had loosened a knot in his chest that he&#39;d been carrying so long he&#39;d forgotten it was there.</p>
<p>Maybe Brad had been right. Maybe he had been working too hard. Maybe this was just him making healthy choices. Maybe he was finally learning to relax.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Two days later, Alex opened the refrigerator looking for something to eat for breakfast and was immediately assaulted by a smell that suggested something had died, decomposed, and then continued its journey into states of matter that science hadn&#39;t yet named.</p>
<p>Five takeout containers sat on the top shelf in various states of decay. Some had been there since before their parents died. All were Brad&#39;s. Alex recognized the containers from the Chinese place two blocks over that Brad kept ordering from despite the fact that their Yelp reviews included phrases like &quot;mild food poisoning&quot; and &quot;probably a front for something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, Brad!&quot; Alex yelled toward the bedroom. &quot;There&#39;s rotting takeout containers everywhere. It&#39;s disgusting what you eat. This is fucking nasty!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad appeared in the kitchen doorway looking annoyed at being interrupted. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This!&quot; Alex gestured at the open refrigerator like it was evidence of a crime. &quot;How long has this shit been in here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. A few days?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try a few weeks. It&#39;s growing things. Things with fuzzy colors. I think one of them is developing sentience.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s expression hardened. &quot;Whatever! You need to stop being so uptight and controlling.&quot;</p>
<p>They glared at each other. Alex grabbed his wallet and his phone. &quot;I&#39;m going to work. Don&#39;t touch my stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>He left, slamming the door hard enough to make the macram&eacute; owl swing on its hook.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The next morning, Brad woke up early-his new routine apparently sticking despite his better judgment-and went for his walk. When he came back, sweaty and strangely energized, he opened the refrigerator to get water and saw the takeout containers still sitting there.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s disgusting what you eat.&quot; Alex&#39;s words echoed in his head.</p>
<p>As he stared at the containers, he realized Alex had been right. Brad had a collection of garbage scattered around the house. Takeout containers on the coffee table from restaurants he couldn&#39;t remember ordering from. Pizza boxes stacked near the TV like a cardboard tower of shame. Empty protein bar wrappers stuffed between couch cushions where they&#39;d formed a small civilization.</p>
<p>Brad spent the next hour cleaning. He cleaned out the refrigerator. Wiped down the counters. Threw away the mystery containers from the back of the pantry that predated their parents&#39; death.</p>
<p>Then he went to the grocery store.</p>
<p>Brad grabbed things at random: chicken breasts, brown rice, bags of frozen vegetables that looked nutritious and vaguely punishing. Protein powder because the guy at the gym had mentioned it. A collection of supplements that promised various improvements to his life.</p>
<p>That evening, he spent two hours on YouTube learning how to meal prep. By the next afternoon, he had five days of portioned meals in tupperware containers, all lined up in the refrigerator in neat rows. Chicken and rice and broccoli. The same meal five times. It looked boring. It looked healthy. It looked like something a functional adult would do.</p>
<p>When Alex got home from work, he opened the fridge and stared.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you... cook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. So what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. It&#39;s just... when did you learn to cook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;YouTube. Turns out there are tutorials for everything, including how to function like an adult.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at the tupperware containers, all labeled with days of the week in Brad&#39;s handwriting. Then he noticed the disaster in the kitchen-every pot and pan they owned piled in the sink, chicken juice on the counter, rice scattered across the stove.</p>
<p>He felt his jaw tighten. He opened his mouth to say something about cleaning up after yourself, about how meal prep was great but maybe try not to destroy the kitchen in the process-</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s voice from earlier echoed in his head. &quot;You need to stop being so uptight and controlling.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex closed his mouth. Took a breath. &quot;Looks good,&quot; he said instead, and walked to his room.</p>

<p>A week later, Alex arrived home with his arms full of shopping bags. He&#39;d found himself compelled to put $500 he definitely didn&#39;t have on his credit card after Brad had commented on him always wearing &quot;the same wrinkled suits to work like a funeral director who&#39;s really bad at his job.&quot; He now had three new dress shirts in colors that weren&#39;t gray, two pairs of slacks that actually fit, a burgundy sweater the salesperson had insisted on, and even a leather jacket he&#39;d probably never have the courage to wear.</p>
<p>He found Brad on the couch wearing blue basketball shorts and a sweatshirt in some kind of neon green that seemed designed to be visible from space-the result of Brad&#39;s own shopping trip after Alex had retorted that morning that Brad had only worn black and grey since Hannah died.</p>
<p>For once, Alex couldn&#39;t detect Brad&#39;s usual post-gym aroma. Over the last few days, Brad had developed a proper hygiene routine. Actual showers with soap. Deodorant. Cologne. The basics, really, but consistently. All because Alex had commented, post-run, that Brad &quot;smelled like a gym locker.&quot;</p>
<p>In retaliation, Brad had told Alex his hair looked like he&#39;d &quot;cut it himself with safety scissors while drunk&quot;-mostly accurate, except for the drunk part. This led to Alex scheduling an appointment with a stylist named Ramona who&#39;d spent two hours transforming his self-inflicted disaster into something that made him look, according to Derek, &quot;like an actual human person.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look good,&quot; Brad said, eyeing the bags. &quot;New clothes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. You too. The color thing is... working.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>They blinked at each other for a long moment, not sure how to end a conversation that didn&#39;t involve petty insults. Alex finally turned and headed to his room to put away his purchases.</p>
<p>Brad watched him go, then turned to face a camera that wasn&#39;t there. &quot;And so the Tate brothers discover that living together might not be so bad after all. They&#39;re helping each other. Growing. Becoming better men. Will this trend continue? Or will their old habits return? Find out next time, on The Tates.&quot;</p>
