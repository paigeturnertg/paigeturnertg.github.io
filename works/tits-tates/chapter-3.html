        <p class="drop-cap">EPISODE 3: CONTRACT KILLERS</p>
<p>CAMERA PANS across a living room that could only be described as &quot;aggressively 1970s.&quot; The kind of d&eacute;cor that archaeologists would one day unearth and use as evidence that the entire decade had been an elaborate prank that had gotten wildly out of hand.</p>
<p>NARRATOR (V.O.) Last time on Tits for Tates: Alex and Brad signed a roommate agreement that was more than they bargained for. After a series of complaints, both brothers discovered the contract had some unexpected side effects.</p>
<p>CAMERA ZOOMS on the macram&eacute; owl hanging on the wall. Its knotted eyes stare with the patient judgment of textile art that has seen too much.</p>
<p>NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT&#39;D) Brad doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s in the mood to narrate anymore. Hard to maintain a witty voice-over when you sound like a sorority girl asking for directions. So I&#39;m stepping in. Owls see everything, you know.</p>
<p>The thing about declaring war at 11:47 PM was that it didn&#39;t give you time to develop strategy or consider long-term consequences. It just gave you anger, adrenaline, and the kind of poor judgment that had led to some of history&#39;s most regrettable decisions. Though few of those decisions had resulted in quite this type of transformation.</p>
<p>Brad stood in the doorway of Alex&#39;s bedroom, staring at his brother. When he opened his mouth to speak, what emerged was bright and perky and energetic, like someone selling activewear on QVC. &quot;You changed my voice!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You changed mine first!&quot; Alex&#39;s voice came out breathy and soft, intimate in a way that suggested candlelit dinners and secrets whispered in dark rooms. Deeply inappropriate for an argument with one&#39;s brother in a hallway at midnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Mine was a mistake. But you-you meant to make mine sound like this!&quot; Brad gestured at his throat with the kind of outrage that would have been more effective if his voice didn&#39;t make it sound like he was inviting everyone to join him on his wellness journey.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you had it coming!&quot;</p>
<p>The thing about mutual destruction was that it rarely started with a clear plan. It started with spite, escalated through pride, and ended with both parties wondering how they&#39;d arrived at this particular circle of hell. Or in this case, this particular hallway with avocado green carpet in a color even an avocado would be ashamed of.</p>
<p>&quot;So you decided to-&quot; Brad stopped, breathing hard. His new voice cracked. &quot;You know what? Your face is ugly.&quot;</p>
<p>The change was immediate. Alex&#39;s features shifted-jawline softening, cheekbones rising slightly, the angles of his face becoming gentler, more delicate. Alex touched his face, feeling the difference, trying to push back against the shifting cheekbones and flowing collagen. &quot;What did you-&quot; But he knew already that Brad had fired the next shot.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed, scanning Brad&#39;s form for something to latch onto. They stopped somewhere around his midsection. &quot;Your beer gut is disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt his waist cinch inward like an invisible corset tightening around his middle. His hips flared outward, his body reorganizing itself into an hourglass shape that made his compression shirt suddenly cling in all the wrong places. His whole silhouette shifted into something that would be described in polite company as &quot;curvy&quot; and in Brad&#39;s internal monologue as &quot;absolutely not what I signed up for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your feet always smell terrible,&quot; Brad shot back, having apparently decided that if he was going down, Alex was coming with him.</p>
<p>Alex felt a strange sensation in his feet-bones shifting, arches rising, toes becoming smaller and more delicate. He looked down to see his feet had shrunk, becoming dainty and unmistakably feminine. Peeking out from the cuff of his trousers he could see the gleam of pink polished toenails that definitely weren&#39;t there a moment ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Well&hellip; your hands are stupid?&quot; Alex hissed, immediately cursing himself for not coming up with something better in the moment.</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s hands contracted, bones shifting. His fingers became slender, his palms narrowed. He stared at these smaller, more graceful hands and his first thought was that at least the nails weren&#39;t long extensions like Alex&#39;s pink claws. Small comfort. Then he watched as electric blue polish bloomed across each nail, the color unmistakable and impossible to hide. Short and practical, but undeniably, visibly feminine.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, your hair is drab.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex felt a tingling across his scalp. His hair lightened rapidly-from brown to honey to golden to platinum blonde. The transformation swept through every strand. Though the style remained masculine, the resulting color was one that no man would ever choose.</p>
<p>&quot;At least mine isn&#39;t thinning!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s hair grew until it reached his shoulders, became fuller, shinier. The kind of hair that existed only in shampoo commercials. Strands kept sliding across his face, tickling his neck, draping over his shoulders like they were trying to introduce themselves. Brad had never been this aware of his own hair before and deeply resented the experience.</p>
<p>And so it went. Back and forth, neither willing to stop, neither willing to let the other win, both of them locked in the kind of mutually destructive spiral that historians would later describe as &quot;profoundly stupid&quot; and sitcom writers would describe as &quot;pure gold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your butt-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your shoulders-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your lips-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your hips-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;STOP!&quot; Brad finally shouted, his perky voice cracking with desperation in a way that rather undermined the authority he was going for. &quot;Just-stop!&quot;</p>
<p>They stood there, both breathing hard, both transformed in ways that would require significantly more than an apology to undo. The brothers had experienced many indignities in their forty-plus years, but having an argument about whose lips were pillowier and who was to blame for it was rapidly climbing the rankings. The hallway bore silent witness to their folly, the wood paneling offering no judgment, the shag carpet absorbing their despair along with decades of accumulated dust.</p>
<p>&quot;This is your fault,&quot; Alex said, his breathy voice shaking in a way that made the accusation sound more like a confession.</p>
<p>&quot;My fault? You started it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After you-&quot; Alex cut himself off, realizing that rehashing the argument would likely result in more changes, and they&#39;d both had quite enough of those for one evening. &quot;I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And tomorrow we&#39;re fixing this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; Alex&#39;s voice cracked. &quot;But we&#39;re figuring it out!&quot;</p>
<p>He turned and walked to his room-his new gait making his hips sway with each step in a way that was deeply unfair-and slammed the door with the kind of emphasis that suggested he&#39;d really like to slam it harder but had been defeated by the fundamental physics of hollow-core doors from 1974.</p>
<p>A moment later, Brad&#39;s door slammed too.</p>
<p>Silence settled over the house like a disapproving relative. Both brothers, alone with what they&#39;d done to each other, what they&#39;d done to themselves, and the dawning realization that spite, while emotionally satisfying in the moment, had some truly unfortunate long-term consequences.</p>
<p>NARRATOR (V.O.) We&#39;ll be right back after these messages. Don&#39;t touch that dial-when we return, the Tate brothers discover that sleeping on a problem doesn&#39;t make it go away. Especially when the problem you&#39;re sleeping on is your new bubble butt.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Morning brought aggressively cheerful sunlight that didn&#39;t care about your problems, your existential crises, or the fact that the body you were waking up in bore little resemblance to how it looked twenty-four hours prior. It streamed through curtains that were, improbably, a different shade of orange than the ones in the living room, but somehow precisely the same amount of ugly.</p>
<p>Brad woke up to his alarm and for one blissful second, forgot everything. Then he moved-and his body reminded him. Everything felt different because everything was different, and morning sunlight was far less forgiving than midnight adrenaline. His body was wrong, his voice when he groaned was wrong, the way he shifted in bed was wrong. It was the kind of comprehensive wrongness that came from experiencing last night&#39;s changes with fresh eyes and a clearer head.</p>
<p>The person who desperately scrambled to the mirror wasn&#39;t quite him anymore.</p>
<p>His shoulders were narrow, his waist impossibly cinched inward while his hips and ass flared outward in an hourglass shape that made his old t-shirt hang oddly-tight in some places, loose in others, like it had been purchased for a different person who no longer existed. His face had changed: softer jawline, higher cheekbones, fuller lips. Feminine features on a face that was still recognizably his but also fundamentally different, like someone had taken his face and run it through a filter labeled &quot;pretty girl.&quot;</p>
<p>His hands were smaller too, more delicate, with those short, practical painted nails. His hair was fuller, shinier, and clearly a woman&#39;s style. Everything about his silhouette had shifted into curves where there had been straight lines.</p>
<p>After trying for several minutes to reconcile the person in the mirror with the person he&#39;d been yesterday and failing completely, Brad gave up and gave in to his new compulsions. It was easier this way.</p>
<p>He pulled on his running gear-compression shirt, athletic shorts, the outfit he&#39;d somehow been compelled to wear since Alex&#39;s complaint about his workout clothes. He needed to run. Needed to think. Needed to do something other than stare at his reflection and wonder how he&#39;d gotten here.</p>
<p>He stepped outside into the cool morning air and started his tracking app.</p>
<p>Running in his new body was, to put it in the kind of understated terms that grossly misrepresented the situation, different.</p>
<p>His narrowed waist and wider hips had fundamentally altered his center of gravity, and his body kept trying to compensate in ways his brain hadn&#39;t approved. Each stride felt like a negotiation between what his legs expected to do and what they were actually doing. His hips rolled with each step in a way that felt profoundly wrong, his ass-his bubble butt, jesus christ-bouncing with a momentum that made him acutely aware it existed. The compression shirt, sized for his old torso, gaped loose around his cinched waist and kept riding up over his hips no matter how many times he tugged it down.</p>
<p>And his hair. His lustrous, shampoo-commercial hair that he hadn&#39;t bothered to tie back because he hadn&#39;t thought about it, kept whipping across his face with every stride, sticking to the sweat on his forehead, getting in his mouth when he tried to breathe. He had to keep pushing it back, tucking it behind his ears where it refused to stay, acutely aware that this was something women did and he was doing it now, repeatedly, while running down his own street.</p>
<p>A car passed him from behind, slowed slightly. Brad could feel the driver&#39;s eyes on him-probably saw the narrow waist, the butt, the hair, and made assumptions. Then the car pulled ahead and the driver&#39;s head turned, looking at him from the front. Brad watched confusion flicker across the man&#39;s face as his brain tried to reconcile &quot;woman from behind&quot; with &quot;something&#39;s not quite right from the front.&quot; The car sped up and disappeared around the corner.</p>
<p>Brad tried to focus on the pavement, on his breathing, on his pace. But his body wouldn&#39;t let him forget. Every movement was a reminder: the unfamiliar roll of his hips, the bounce of his ass, the hair in his face, the way his own silhouette felt foreign.</p>
<p>By the time he returned to the house, he was breathing hard and deeply unsettled by the experience. The house loomed before him, still aggressively brown and determinedly 1970s.</p>
<p>Alex was waiting in the kitchen.</p>
<p>He looked different in daylight. The platinum blonde hair was striking, catching the morning sun streaming through the window. He was still in his pajamas. Boxer shorts and an old t-shirt that hung oddly on his narrower frame, the shorts riding low on hips that were wider than they used to be. His legs were smooth and hairless, as were his arms, every limb ending in pink nails that were impossible to miss. His features were softer, more feminine. His eyes were the same, but everything else had shifted just enough to be undeniable.</p>
<p>They stared at each other in the kind of silence that spoke volumes, all of them leather-bound and shelved under &#39;Disasters, Fraternal&#39;.</p>
<p>&quot;We fucked up,&quot; Alex said quietly, his breathy voice making even this admission sound like pillow talk.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We really, really fucked up.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s perky voice came out flat, which was its own special kind of wrongness. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>As they waited for their parents&#39; Mr. Coffee to brew, Alex pulled out his laptop and sat at the kitchen table, a chrome and Formica monstrosity in a shade best described as &quot;stupendously beige.&quot; Brad joined him, as if they were about to have a normal morning meeting about normal problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Alex said, steadier than Brad expected. &quot;Let&#39;s think about this logically. What do we know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We know complaints trigger changes,&quot; Brad said. &quot;We don&#39;t have to direct our complaints at one another or even be around each other. We don&#39;t even have to mean it, we can just be mad at each other and finding things to complain about out of spite. And-&quot; He gestured at himself with hands that were notably smaller than they&#39;d been yesterday. &quot;We know they all do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Make us into girls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pulled up the contract on his screen, as if legalese or logic might somehow explain the magic. &quot;Every single change has pushed us in the same direction. Your voice, my voice, our bodies, our features. It&#39;s not random. It&#39;s systematic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I complained about your voice being annoying,&quot; Brad said. &quot;There are a thousand ways to fix &#39;annoying voice.&#39; But instead, you got a voice that sounds like you&#39;re a phone sex operator.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So the contract isn&#39;t just fixing complaints. It&#39;s interpreting them through a specific lens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Feminization,&quot; Brad said, as if naming the thing would give them power over it, which was a nice thought but almost certainly wrong. &quot;Everything gets twisted into making us more feminine.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat with that for a moment, processing the implications, which were extensive and uniformly terrible. The kitchen clock-a sunburst design in gold-tone metal that suggested it had never told accurate time and was quite proud of that fact-ticked away the seconds of their growing dread.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Brad said finally. &quot;So we know what it&#39;s doing. Now we need to figure out how to stop it.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the next few hours, they tried everything they could think of, which turned out to be a series of increasingly desperate and decreasingly rational strategies. The website Alex had downloaded the agreement from was still there, but the customer feedback form seemed to be missing a &quot;submit&quot; button. The phone number was disconnected. According to Google Maps, the address of the company was now a Spirit Halloween store. They called lawyers-three of them. One laughed and hung up, one asked if they&#39;d been drinking, and the third suggested psychiatric help before disconnecting.</p>
<p>In a fit of desperation that would have been embarrassing if their current situation wasn&#39;t already beyond embarrassment, they printed out the contract and fed it through the shredder. The paper strips sat in the waste basket, mocking their complete ineffectiveness. Alex tried deleting the file from his phone, but it was set as &quot;protected&quot; in the file system and could not be changed. Brad suggested throwing Alex&#39;s phone in the microwave. Alex suggested throwing Brad in the microwave.</p>
<p>They tried reading the contract terms backwards. They tried reading them in a mirror. They even tried a &quot;contract nullification&quot; spell Brad found on Reddit, which required them to burn incense while chanting legal disclaimers, and accomplished exactly nothing except making the house smell like a college dorm room.</p>
<p>By early afternoon, they were out of ideas and out of hope.</p>
<p>&quot;No one believes us,&quot; Brad said finally, his voice tight with frustration.</p>
<p>&quot;Why would they? We&#39;re saying we signed a magical contract that&#39;s physically transforming us every time we complain. We sound insane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What if we just leave?&quot; Brad asked. &quot;Just go. Move out. The contract is a roommate agreement, right? What if we weren&#39;t roommates anymore?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think it&#39;s that simple?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we won&#39;t know unless we try.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad walked to his room, past walls decorated with portraits of their family dressed in matching turtlenecks, and started packing his gym bag. He grabbed his compression workout clothes, the form-fitting athletic wear that he didn&#39;t want to wear but couldn&#39;t seem to stop dressing in. Toiletries from the bathroom. His laptop. Chargers. His collection of classic sitcom DVDs. Everything he&#39;d need to not come back, to start over somewhere else, to escape this house and this contract and this nightmare.</p>
<p>He zipped the bag. Grabbed his keys and wallet. Walked back to the living room where Alex was sitting on the couch and watching him with an expression that suggested he already knew how this was going to end.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to Trevor&#39;s,&quot; Brad said. &quot;I&#39;ll call you when I get there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad walked to the front door. Opened it. The morning air was cool and normal and ordinary, the kind of air that didn&#39;t care about whether the person breathing it had signed a magical contract that was turning him into a girl. He slung his duffel bag over his shoulder and stepped through the doorway.</p>
<p>The bag yanked back on his shoulder like it had snagged on something.</p>
<p>Brad turned to look. Nothing was caught. The doorframe was clear-no errant nail, no protruding screw, nothing that could have caused the bag to catch. But the bag wouldn&#39;t cross the threshold. It was physically stuck at the plane of the door, refusing to leave the house with the kind of stubborn determination usually reserved for housecats who didn&#39;t want to go to the vet.</p>
<p>&quot;What the-&quot; Brad pulled harder. The bag didn&#39;t budge. He could feel it on his shoulder, could lift it, could move it around inside the house-but the moment he tried to pull it across that invisible line between inside and outside, it became an immovable object in the most literal sense possible.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell,&quot; Brad muttered, his perky voice making the profanity sound oddly cheerful, like he was disappointed his favorite smoothie place was closed rather than discovering his possessions were trapped in a house by supernatural forces. He set the bag down just inside the door, grabbed it with both hands, planted his feet on the porch, and pulled with all his strength.</p>
<p>Which admittedly wasn&#39;t as much strength as it had been two days ago.</p>
<p>Nothing. The bag sat there, mocking him with its absolute refusal to cooperate.</p>
<p>&quot;Brad?&quot; Alex had come to see what was happening, drawn by the sounds of struggling and frustrated muttering.</p>
<p>&quot;It won&#39;t move. I can&#39;t get it outside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean it won&#39;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean it won&#39;t move!&quot; Brad&#39;s voice cracked. &quot;Watch.&quot;</p>
<p>He demonstrated, moving the bag freely inside the house, then attempting and failing to pull it through the doorway. It was the kind of demonstration that would have been more effective if it wasn&#39;t so profoundly depressing.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can&#39;t take our stuff out,&quot; Alex said quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently not.&quot;</p>
<p>They stared at the bag sitting in the doorway, a monument to their failed escape attempt.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck it,&quot; Brad said desperately. &quot;I&#39;ll just go without it. I&#39;ll buy new stuff. I don&#39;t care.&quot;</p>
<p>He stepped outside, empty-handed now, standing on the porch and looking out at the driveway, the street beyond, the world that existed outside this house. Freedom. Escape. The possibility of a life that involved non-magical contracts and non-avocado carpet. He took a single step away from the door.</p>
<p>The punishment hit immediately. It started in his chest. A tingling sensation that became pressure, became heat, became wrongness spreading beneath his skin like something was growing that had no business being there. Brad looked down and watched in horror as tissue began to swell under his compression shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he gasped, his hands flying to his chest, trying to push back against the growth. His palms pressed flat against his pecs, trying to stop it, trying to force it back in. &quot;No, no, no-&quot;</p>
<p>But he could feel it happening under his hands. Tissue expanding, redistributing, growing despite his desperate attempts to push it back. The sensation was deeply wrong in a way that went beyond physical discomfort-flesh swelling where there should be none, his body reshaping itself while he stood there helpless to stop it.</p>

        </figure>
        
<p>Brad stumbled back inside, away from the doorway, still pressing his hands against his chest as if physical pressure could somehow reverse what was happening. But the growth continued, steady and inexorable. Small bumps became swells became unmistakable breasts-small but undeniable, A-cup at most, nipples clearly visible under his tight compression shirt.</p>
<p>When it finally stopped, Brad was breathing hard, his hands still pressed against his new chest. The weight was strange, the sensation foreign. He looked down at the small mounds pushing against the fabric of his shirt, creating curves that definitely weren&#39;t there ninety seconds ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Alex breathed, staring with the kind of expression that suggested he was having his own existential crisis just by witnessing this.</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s perky voice came out broken, which was at least emotionally appropriate even if it sounded deeply wrong. &quot;It punished me. I tried to leave-I was going to leave for real-and it punished me.&quot;</p>
<p>He gestured helplessly at himself, at his new chest, at the evidence of what happened when you tried to escape.</p>
<p>Alex was already pulling out his laptop, yanking up the contract document with the kind of frantic energy that suggested he thought answers might be hiding in the legalese. Which, it turned out, they were-though not the kind of answers anyone wanted.</p>
<p>They found it in Section 8-B, buried in paragraphs of mutual obligations, written in the kind of language that lawyers used when they wanted to say something terrible in the politest possible way.</p>
<p>&quot;In furtherance of ensuring bona fide cohabitation and to prevent unilateral abandonment of shared obligations, both parties hereby covenant to maintain continuous physical residency within the premises for the full term of this Agreement,&quot; Alex read aloud, his voice tight. &quot;Any attempt to vacate, abandon, or otherwise terminate said residency shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to breach the co-tenancy obligation and to impose undue burden upon the non-departing party, and shall trigger immediate corrective measures of escalating magnitude as determined necessary to restore compliance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Immediate corrective measures,&quot; Brad repeated. &quot;That&#39;s what this was. And it said &#39;increasing severity.&#39; Meaning if I try again-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;ll be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>They looked at each other across the space of the living room.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#39;t leave,&quot; Brad said. &quot;We literally cannot leave. The agreement won&#39;t let us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not without-&quot; Alex gestured at Brad&#39;s chest. &quot;More of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad sat down heavily on the couch, which exhaled a small cloud of dust and resignation. His new breasts shifted and bounced with the motion in a way that made him acutely, horrifyingly aware of their presence. Every movement sent unfamiliar sensations through his chest. &quot;So we&#39;re trapped. We can&#39;t get help, we can&#39;t contact the company, and we can&#39;t leave.&quot;</p>
<p>The silence stretched between them like a physical thing, heavy with implications and the dawning understanding of just how thoroughly screwed they were.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Alex asked finally.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Brad whimpered.</p>
<p>They sat there in silence for a long moment, both processing the full scope of their trap, both trying to find some strategy, some plan, some way forward that didn&#39;t involve more changes and more horror.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Alex said finally. &quot;We need a strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A strategy for what? We&#39;re stuck here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly. We&#39;re stuck here. At least until we sell the house. So we need to figure out how to survive without...&quot; He gestured at Brad&#39;s chest. &quot;You know.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad grimaced at the reminder. &quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mutually assured destruction,&quot; Alex said, warming to the theme in the way he always did when he thought he&#39;d found a solution. &quot;It&#39;s the only strategy that makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think about it. We each hold the key to the other&#39;s complete destruction. One complaint and we can ruin each other. Make it worse. Push this further.&quot; Alex gestured at Brad&#39;s chest, at his own pink talons. &quot;So we don&#39;t. We recognize the reality. If you do anything, I&#39;ll make it worse. If I do anything, you&#39;ll retaliate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s insane.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It worked for the US and USSR for forty years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They had nuclear weapons, not bikini bods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The principle is the same,&quot; Alex insisted, taking on a lecturing tone that suggested he&#39;d comprehensively thought this through in the last twenty seconds. &quot;We both know what we can do to each other. We both know the consequences. So we don&#39;t. We can still interact, still live in the same house, but we&#39;re very, very careful. Any complaint triggers retaliation, so we don&#39;t complain. We maintain the balance through mutual threat.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad looked at him-at his blonde hair, his feminine features, his unconsciously graceful movements. Then down at himself-at his breasts, his delicate hands, his changed body that was a constant reminder of what happened when they lost control.</p>
<p>&quot;You really think we can do that? Just... never slip up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to try. What&#39;s the alternative?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad didn&#39;t have an answer to that, which was perhaps answer enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; he said. &quot;D&eacute;tente. We&#39;re careful. We don&#39;t complain. We remember the consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>They shook on it, their feminine hands clasping awkwardly, sealing a pact that both of them suspected wouldn&#39;t last.</p>
<p>Brad went to his room and found a gray hoodie. The largest one he owned, leftover from before the compression clothes compulsion started. It felt wrong to wear it, uncomfortable in the way that all baggy clothes felt now, like wearing someone else&#39;s skin. But he forced himself to pull it on, tugging it down over his chest, desperate to hide his new proportions. He crossed his arms to conceal the curves that wouldn&#39;t be hidden. It wasn&#39;t perfect. But it would have to do. He grabbed a pair of black sweatpants and forced those on as well.</p>
<p>When he emerged, Alex was already back in his room. The house was quiet in the way of houses that contained people actively avoiding each other, the silence broken only by the occasional creak of settling wood and the persistent hum of appliances that had been running since the Ford administration.</p>
<p>Maybe this could work, Brad thought. Maybe if they just avoided each other, stayed apart, refused to engage-maybe they could make it through this without changing any further.</p>
<p>NARRATOR (V.O.) And so the Tate brothers retreated to their separate corners, having established what political scientists would call &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; and what anyone with common sense would call &quot;a terrible idea that&#39;s definitely going to blow up in their faces.&quot; Will it?
