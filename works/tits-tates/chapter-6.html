        <p class="drop-cap">NARRATOR (V.O.): Welcome back! When we last left our heroes-heroines?-Alex had just opened the door wearing women&#39;s clothing and kitchen accessories. Richard and Carol are processing. Alex is panicking. And somewhere upstairs, Brad is about to make a series of decisions he&#39;ll immediately regret. Let&#39;s watch this dinner party crash and burn, shall we?</p>
<p>&quot;New hair?&quot; Richard tried, his eyes traveling from Alex&#39;s platinum blonde hair to the apron to the oven mitts, clearly trying to process the entire situation at once.</p>
<p>Alex waved one oven mitt awkwardly. &quot;Midlife crisis? Just trying something different. Come in, please! Sorry about the-&quot; He gestured at himself with both mitts. &quot;I was just checking on dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Carol said, in the tone of someone who was definitely not thinking &quot;of course&quot; but was too polite to say otherwise. &quot;Your voice-are you feeling alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Laryngitis,&quot; Alex lied smoothly, the excuse coming easily. &quot;Had it all week. Very annoying.&quot;</p>
<p>They moved into the living room. Alex offered drinks-wine, beer, cocktails, anything to get through the next few hours. Richard asked for scotch. Carol wanted white wine.</p>
<p>Alex moved to pour them, then realized he was still wearing the oven mitts.</p>
<p>This presented a problem. He needed to take them off to pour drinks. But taking them off would reveal the nails. The perfect, pink, professionally manicured nails that would require explanation.</p>
<p>He stood there for a moment, frozen between two bad options, very aware that Richard and Carol were watching him.</p>
<p>&quot;Alex?&quot; Richard said. &quot;Why are you still wearing oven mitts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My hands are cold!&quot; The lie came out desperately. &quot;Always cold. Circulation issues. Poor circulation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s seventy-five degrees out?&quot; Carol observed.</p>
<p>&quot;Very poor circulation,&quot; Alex insisted, already moving toward the bar cart with the oven mitts still on. He&#39;d pour the drinks wearing them. He&#39;d make it work somehow.</p>
<p>He picked up a wine glass with both quilted hands, held it awkwardly, reached for the bottle, and by some miracle poured Carol&#39;s wine without spilling it. He turned, gingerly walked on his high heels over to where Carol had settled into his parents&#39; ancient couch, reached out with the glass.</p>
<p>The glass slipped through his mitts.</p>
<p>White wine splashed across the coffee table, soaking into the TV Guide from 1987. If it wasn&#39;t already fused to the table, it was now. The Guide had survived the Reagan administration, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the advent of digital television. It would probably have survived nuclear war. It would not, however, survive this dinner party. Alex lunged forward to grab the glass, his oven-mitted hands completely useless, managing only to knock over Carol&#39;s purse in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, let me-&quot; Carol was already up, grabbing the glass, reaching for Alex&#39;s hands. &quot;Take those off so we can clean this up properly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I can-&quot;</p>
<p>But Carol had already grabbed the edge of one mitt and pulled.</p>
<p>The oven mitt came off, revealing Alex&#39;s hand in all its glory. The long pink nails, professionally shaped and polished. They were undeniable. Impossible to miss. Carol froze, mitt in hand, staring.</p>
<p>Alex pulled off the other mitt himself, defeated. Both hands visible now. Both sets of nails on full display.</p>
<p>Silence stretched across the living room.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that a&hellip; manicure?&quot; Carol asked finally, her tone suggesting she&#39;d discovered evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>&quot;I&hellip; lost a bet,&quot; he said, the lie coming from nowhere. &quot;At work. With Derek. He made me get them done and I haven&#39;t had time to remove the polish yet.&quot;</p>
<p>They cleaned up the wine in awkward silence. Alex poured new drinks-properly this time, with his pink nails visible the entire time. Richard and Carol exchanged glances that clearly communicated &quot;we&#39;ll discuss this in the car on the way home.&quot;</p>
<p>The laugh track started exactly thirty seconds later.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Brad had meant to stay quiet. He really had. The plan was simple: stay in his room, keep silent, let Alex handle dinner alone. He could do that. He was an adult. He could sit in silence for two hours.</p>
<p>But the boredom was crushing. His sitcom DVD collection was right on the shelf. And there, in the corner, sat his parents&#39; old tube TV. Massive, boxy, paired with a DVD-VHS combo player that probably dated to 2003. What was the harm in watching one episode? Just one. He&#39;d wear headphones. No one would know.</p>
<p>He put in Cheers. Thanksgiving Orphans, the food fight episode. Season five, still the Diane years. He&#39;d never been a Rebecca fan. Plugged his headphones into the combo player&#39;s jack. Started the episode, being responsible, being considerate.</p>
<p>Ten minutes in, he shifted position on the bed to get more comfortable. His foot caught the headphone cord.</p>
<p>The plug yanked free from the jack.</p>
<p>HA HA HA HA HA HA HA</p>
<p>The laugh track exploded through the old house&#39;s thin walls at full volume. Canned 1980s sitcom laughter, enthusiastic and artificial and impossible to ignore, blaring directly from the TV speakers.</p>
<p>Brad lunged for the remote, frantically stabbing at the volume button. Nothing happened. The batteries were dead. He threw it aside and scrambled toward the TV itself, but the laugh track kept going.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>In the living room, everyone froze.</p>
<p>HA HA HA HA HA HA</p>
<p>Richard set down his scotch. &quot;Is that&hellip; laughter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Alex said immediately, his mind racing for explanations. &quot;That&#39;s just... the radiator.&quot;</p>
<p>Carol tilted her head. &quot;Your radiator sounds like a laugh track?&quot;</p>
<p>HA HA HA HA HA HA</p>
<p>&quot;Old house,&quot; Alex tried. &quot;The pipes do weird things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s definitely a television,&quot; Richard said, standing up. &quot;Is someone else here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! No one else! Just me! Living alone! Very alone!&quot; Alex was aware he was protesting too much and it was making him sound increasingly unhinged. &quot;It&#39;s probably... the neighbors! Sound travels! These old houses, very thin walls!&quot;</p>
<p>HA HA HA HA HA HA</p>
<p>Carol was already moving toward the stairs. &quot;That&#39;s coming from inside this house, Alex.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait-&quot; Alex tried to block them, stepping in front of Carol with his arms spread wide. &quot;You really don&#39;t need to-&quot;</p>
<p>But they were already past him, drawn by curiosity and the unmistakable sound of Cheers coming from the second floor. Alex followed, panic rising in his chest as he watched his carefully constructed plan disintegrate in real-time.</p>
<p>They reached Brad&#39;s door. The laugh track was clearly coming from inside.</p>
<p>Richard knocked. &quot;Hello? Is someone in there?&quot;</p>
<p>The laugh track cut off abruptly. Silence.</p>
<p>Richard opened the door without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Brad was standing in the middle of his room, frozen, holding the DVD-VHS combo player in both hands like he was an athleisure-clad catburglar. Cables dangled from the back from where he&#39;d ripped it from the TV. Behind him, the TV showed static.</p>
<p>He stared at Richard and Carol. They stared back.</p>
<p>The silence stretched long enough to become uncomfortable, then transcended uncomfortable and entered the realm of absolute mortification.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi?&quot; Brad said finally, his perky voice bright and cheerful and completely at odds with the tension in the room.</p>
<p>Richard turned slowly to look at Alex, who was standing in the doorway in his blouse and heels and pink nails. &quot;Alex. Who is this?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s brain, which had been running on fumes and panic for the last three hours, completely short-circuited. He opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked at Brad. Looked at Richard and Carol. Needed an explanation, needed a story, needed something that would make this make sense.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Bra.. ndy,&quot; he heard himself say. &quot;Brandy. My sister.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your sister?&quot; Carol repeated slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. My sister Brandy.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad-Brandy-raised his hand in a limp wave. &quot;That&#39;s me, I&#39;m&hellip; Brandy.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard was looking between them, his expression suggesting he was processing information and not liking the conclusions he was reaching. &quot;You never told me you had a sister, Alex.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She hasn&#39;t been in my life much until recently,&quot; Alex said, the words carrying an irony that only he and Brad could appreciate.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why is she living here?&quot; Carol asked, her social training clearly straining under the weight of this situation.</p>
<p>&quot;I-I just moved in!&quot; Brad said brightly. &quot;I&#39;m between jobs and needed a place to stay temporarily!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Between jobs,&quot; Richard repeated flatly.</p>
<p>&quot;Between&hellip; gyms? I teach classes?&quot; Brad gestured at himself like his outfit was evidence, which it was, though perhaps not the kind of evidence that helped their case.</p>
<p>Carol was studying Brad now, her eyes traveling over his face, his body, his whole presentation. &quot;You look very familiar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have one of those faces!&quot; Brad said quickly. &quot;Very generic! Common features!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not that. You look like...&quot; Carol trailed off, squinting slightly. &quot;Like someone I&#39;ve seen before.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex felt his stomach drop. The family photos. The hallway full of family photos showing two sons, two brothers, no sisters anywhere. Carol was going to walk past them on her way out-had probably already noticed them on her way in-and there would be no explaining why Brandy appeared nowhere in thirty years of documented family history.</p>
<p>Before anyone could pursue this line of questioning further, the smoke detector started screaming.</p>
<p>BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP</p>
<p>Everyone rushed downstairs, drawn by the urgent mechanical shrieking that suggested something had gone catastrophically wrong. Black smoke was pouring from the kitchen, filling the living room, setting off the detector with increasing urgency.</p>
<p>Richard ran to open windows. Carol grabbed a dish towel and started fanning the smoke detector. Alex rushed to the kitchen and threw open the oven door, releasing a cloud of smoke so thick it had texture. The kind of smoke that made you question whether this was actually smoke or possibly the aurora borealis, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within his oven.</p>
<p>The pot roast was beyond saving. It was charcoal. A meat-shaped carbon sculpture. The vegetables had become one with the pan, fused together through heat and time into something approaching a geological formation.</p>
<p>They all stared at it-the ruined dinner, the destroyed plan, the physical manifestation of how thoroughly this evening had gone wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Richard said after a long moment. &quot;Who wants burgers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I can fix this,&quot; Alex pleaded.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; Brad laughed. &quot;How can you possibly? You have to be the world&#39;s worst cook!&quot;</p>
<p>The change hit Alex like a door slamming open in his mind. Complete cooking knowledge flooded in-every technique, every temperature, every ratio and timing and chemical reaction that transformed ingredients into food. He saw the pot roast with new eyes, understood exactly what had gone wrong: the temperature had been too high, the pan too small, the vegetables cut incorrectly. The marinade needed more acid. The sear should have happened first. The oven rack was positioned wrong.</p>
<p>He knew all of this now. Knew it completely, intimately, the way he knew his own name. He could make perfect pot roast. He could make anything. The knowledge sat in his brain like it had always been there, recipes and techniques and adjustments flowing through his consciousness.</p>
<p>&quot;Alex?&quot; Carol was looking at him with concern. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>He turned away from the oven, his new knowledge making the disaster even more painful to witness. &quot;I&#39;m making a salad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A salad?&quot; Richard sounded skeptical. &quot;For dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A VERY elaborate salad.&quot; Alex was already pulling ingredients from the refrigerator, his hands moving with newfound confidence. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;</p>
<p>The salad he plated fifteen minutes later looked like it belonged in a restaurant. Magazine-worthy. The kind of composed salad that pretentious food blogs would photograph from forty-seven angles.</p>
<p>They sat at the dining room table and ate in awkward silence. The salad was delicious in all the ways a salad isn&#39;t. The kind of thing that made you wonder why you&#39;d ever ordered salad from a restaurant when apparently this was possible at home.</p>
<p>&quot;This is excellent, Alex,&quot; Carol said, genuine surprise in her voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Very impressive,&quot; Richard added, studying Alex like he was trying to figure out when his creative director had found time to attend culinary school.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>Brad ate his salad in silence, aware that he&#39;d just given Alex something valuable, something useful, something that might actually help him in the long run. He felt oddly guilty about that, though he wasn&#39;t sure why. Maybe because it was the first change that seemed like it might be positive rather than purely destructive.</p>
<p>Carol set down her fork and looked at Brad with a warm smile. &quot;You&#39;re so naturally pretty, Brandy. You don&#39;t even need makeup.&quot;</p>
<p>It was meant as a compliment. A nice thing to say. The kind of small talk women made with each other to build rapport. Brad understood that, intellectually. But he also felt his stomach twist, his jaw clench, his whole body reject the adjective &quot;pretty.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex, from across the table, saw Brad&#39;s expression and misread it entirely. &quot;That&#39;s because she&#39;s completely useless about makeup. Doesn&#39;t know the first thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Makeup bloomed across Brad&#39;s face like time-lapse flowers opening. Foundation appeared, sheer and natural, evening out his skin tone. A hint of eyeshadow in neutral browns. Mascara lengthened his lashes. A touch of blush gave him a healthy glow. Lip gloss in a natural pink shade.</p>
<p>It was the kind of makeup that looked like &quot;no makeup.&quot; Subtle, polished, professional. Every detail was perfectly applied, natural enough to seem effortless but precise enough to be undeniable.</p>
<p>But worse-much worse-was the knowledge that flooded Brad&#39;s mind. Color theory. Application techniques. Contouring, blending, highlighting. How to work with different skin tones, different face shapes, different features. Primers, foundations, concealers, every type of eyeshadow and every brush to apply them with. He knew makeup now. Knew it completely. Could do a full face in the dark if needed.</p>
<p>The knowledge sat in his brain next to sitcom trivia and journalism school and everything else that made him him, except this was new, foreign, wrong. He now knew seventeen different techniques for winged eyeliner. He could identify a Sephora from three blocks away. He understood the difference between &#39;dewy&#39; and &#39;matte&#39; finishes. This was hell, but a very well-contoured one.</p>
<p>Carol leaned forward, squinting at Brad&#39;s face. &quot;Wait.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Brad&#39;s voice came out higher than intended.</p>
<p>&quot;I could have sworn you weren&#39;t wearing makeup a minute ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s heart pounded. &quot;I was! I just... it&#39;s very natural. Natural look. That&#39;s my style.&quot;</p>
<p>Carol sat back, still studying him. &quot;I suppose. You are very good at it. Well, I for one am glad to have a salad instead of a heavy pot roast. Us girls need to watch our figures, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Brad said, still chafing at the fact that he had to play &quot;Brandy&quot; around these strangers. &quot;Watch our figures. Unlike Alex. He doesn&#39;t even have a figure to watch.&quot;</p>
<p>The change hit Alex immediately. Pressure in his chest. Tissue swelling, growing, pressing against the blouse beneath the apron. His waist cinched inward even more, the slacks pulling tighter. Hips widened, pushing against the fabric. Breasts developed under his blouse, A-cup at most, but undeniable. And he wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. The apron covered them for now, but if he took it off, the blouse would cling, the light pink fabric would show everything.</p>
<p>Alex jumped up from his chair in a panic. &quot;Let me clear these!&quot; He grabbed Carol&#39;s plate-she still had salad on it-then Richard&#39;s, then Brad&#39;s, stacking them clumsily. A fork clattered to the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Alex, I wasn&#39;t quite-&quot; Carol started.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll just-be right back!&quot; Alex was already moving toward the kitchen, plates clutched against his aproned chest, retreating before anyone could see, before anyone could offer to help, before the apron could shift and reveal what was underneath.</p>
<p>The kitchen door swung shut behind him. He set the plates in the sink with shaking hands, breathing hard.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Brad had followed him into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#39;m not okay!&quot; Alex spun around, his voice tight with panic. &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was I thinking? You started it! The makeup comment-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You made a joke about me not having a figure!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because Carol kept trying to bond with me about being girls! &#39;Us girls need to watch our figures&#39;-I&#39;m not a girl, Alex!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well now I have a figure to watch, don&#39;t I? Thanks to you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You gave me a full face of makeup! In the middle of dinner!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you gave me TITS, Brad!&quot;</p>
<p>A voice boomed out from behind them. &quot;What the HELL is going on here?&quot;</p>
<p>They both spun around. Richard stood behind them in the kitchen, Carol just behind him in the doorway. His face had gone from confused to something harder, something that suggested he&#39;d overheard their argument.</p>
<p>Alex and Brad stared at him, both frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;Richard-&quot; Carol started.</p>
<p>&quot;No. No, Carol.&quot; Richard&#39;s voice was firm. &quot;Something is very wrong here. Alex, you show up looking completely different-the hair, the voice, the nails, wearing women&#39;s clothing. I swear you&#39;re even shorter somehow? Then there&#39;s a sister we&#39;ve never heard about who looks familiar but you can&#39;t explain why. And now-&quot; He gestured vaguely at them. &quot;Now they&#39;re talking about giving each other breasts? What does that even mean?&quot;</p>
<p>It was, Alex reflected, an excellent summary of the evening. If only he could respond with &quot;magic contract&quot; and have that be a satisfactory explanation. But even the truth sounded like a lie.</p>
<p>Carol tugged gently at Richard&#39;s arm. &quot;Let&#39;s give them a moment. They&#39;re clearly upset-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Carol, this is-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A moment, Richard.&quot; Her voice was gentle but insistent. &quot;In the living room.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard stared at Alex for a long moment, then nodded curtly. &quot;Five minutes. You have five minutes to come out there with a good explanation of what&#39;s going on, or you can find yourself a new job, Alex.&quot; He turned and left, Carol guiding him out.</p>
<p>The kitchen door swung shut.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>They stood in the kitchen, both breathing hard, both on the edge of complete breakdown.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we tell them?!&quot; Brad hissed, his perky voice making the panic sound like excited whispering.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can tell them the truth?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#39;ll think we&#39;re insane!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can keep lying?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They already know we&#39;re lying!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex was spiraling, his new breasts rising and falling rapidly with his breathing, his heels clicking on the linoleum as he paced. &quot;This is all your fault! Why couldn&#39;t you just stay hidden?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MY fault?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! Now you&#39;ve made them suspicious of BOTH OF US because everything about this whole situation seems wrong to them!&quot;</p>
<p>The words left Alex&#39;s mouth and reality hiccupped.</p>
<p>It was subtle-a shimmer in the air, like heat waves rising from pavement, like the world had skipped a frame in a film reel. Both of them felt it. A sense of wrongness, of displacement, of something fundamental shifting beneath their feet.</p>
<p>They froze, staring at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot; Brad whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you feel that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something changed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what?&quot;</p>
<p>They stood in the kitchen, both feeling the lingering sensation of reality adjusting itself around them, neither understanding what had happened or what it meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Brad said finally. &quot;We have to go back out there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do we tell them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to tell them the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m so getting fired.&quot;</p>
<p>They steeled themselves. Opened the kitchen door. Walked back to the dining room, dreading the confrontation they were about to have, the explanations they couldn&#39;t give, the disaster that would unfold when Richard and Carol heard their story about a magical roommate agreement.</p>
<p>Richard and Carol were sitting at the table. Relaxed. Smiling. Sipping wine.</p>
<p>Like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are!&quot; Richard said warmly. &quot;We were wondering what was taking so long!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex and Brad exchanged confused looks.</p>
<p>Alex approached carefully, like walking into a minefield. &quot;So... about what we were discussing before...&quot;</p>
<p>Carol tilted her head. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you were asking questions? About everything?&quot;</p>
<p>Richard looked genuinely confused. &quot;Questions? What questions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were just saying how nice it is to finally meet Brandy properly!&quot; Carol smiled at Brad. &quot;You&#39;ve told us so much about your sister over the years, Alex. It&#39;s wonderful to put a face to the name!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt the floor drop out from under him. Richard was nodding. &quot;Yes! And Brandy, your fitness business sounds fascinating. You&#39;ll have to tell us more about training for the London marathon!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s voice came out strangled. &quot;The... London marathon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The one you ran last spring!&quot; Richard said. &quot;You mentioned it earlier, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>No. Brad hadn&#39;t mentioned it. Brad had never run the London marathon. Brad had never been to London. Brad didn&#39;t train people for marathons. For anything, for that matter. Brad was a blogger who watched sitcoms and avoided exercise until a magical contract forced him to run every morning.</p>
<p>But Richard remembered it. Carol remembered it. They remembered Brandy telling them about it. They remembered meeting Brandy before. They remembered Alex talking about his sister.</p>
<p>Carol was still smiling. &quot;And Alex, you look lovely tonight. That blouse is so perfect with your hair.&quot;</p>
<p>No questions about the nails. No suspicion about the clothing. No confusion about the photos. Everything was normal to them. Everything seemed right.</p>
<p>Alex tested it carefully. &quot;So you&#39;re not... concerned? About anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Concerned about what?&quot; Richard asked.</p>
<p>&quot;About how I look?&quot;</p>
<p>Carol laughed. &quot;You look beautiful, honey. Very put-together.&quot;</p>
<p>They didn&#39;t remember being suspicious. They didn&#39;t remember the interrogation. Their memories had changed. Reality had adjusted. Everything about this situation now seemed completely normal to them-Carol and Richard visiting their colleague Alex and his sister Brandy for dinner.</p>
<p>Improbably, the evening continued pleasantly. Alex offered to make everyone coffee, and when he retreated to the kitchen he found a perfect tiramisu in the refrigerator. He stared at it for a long moment. He hadn&#39;t made tiramisu. He&#39;d never made tiramisu in his life. Before tonight, Alex hadn&#39;t even been entirely sure what tiramisu was. Yet here it was, perfect and impossible and completely in line with how this evening was going.</p>
<p>He brought it out without comment.</p>
<p>The conversation over coffee and dessert was pleasant, normal. Discussion of the Mitchelson account, Carol asking Brandy about her fitness classes, Richard genuinely complimenting Alex and talking of promotions in his future. No tension. No suspicion. No questions about the earlier chaos.</p>
<p>Their guests left around 9:47pm, both thanking them warmly at the door. &quot;That was a lovely evening, Alex. Everything was delicious! And Brandy, so wonderful to see you again! We should definitely do this more often!&quot;</p>
<p>They drove away, happy and satisfied, completely convinced they&#39;d just had a normal dinner with normal people in a normal house.</p>
<p>Alex and Brad stood in the doorway, watching the taillights disappear, neither speaking.</p>
<p>After a long moment, they closed the door.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Alex asked finally, his voice quiet in the empty living room.</p>
<p>Brad shook his head. He felt numb. Hollowed out. Like if he thought about what had just happened for even one more second, he&#39;d completely break down. &quot;I have no idea. I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>He headed toward the stairs, desperate to escape this entire nightmare of an evening, desperate to stop thinking, desperate for unconsciousness. But as he passed through the hallway, something caught his eye. He stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Alex,&quot; Brad said slowly. &quot;Look at the photos.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex came to stand beside him.</p>
<p>Their family photos had changed.</p>
<p>Where there had been two boys, Brad and Alex, there were now different images. Their parents standing with one son and one daughter. Alex as a child, platinum blonde even then, delicate and effeminate. Brandy as a child, brunette and athletic and tomboyish.</p>
<p>Every photo showed this version of history. Birthday parties with Alex and Brandy. School photos showing both of them. Family vacations with one son and one daughter. The photos documented a history that had never happened.</p>
<p>Brad pulled out his phone with shaking hands. Device name: Brandy&#39;s iPhone. Social media profiles: Brandy Tate, Fitness Instructor. Posts about training clients, marathon running, fitness classes. Client testimonials. Certifications. A whole professional history that had never existed.</p>
<p>Comments from friends calling him &quot;Brandy,&quot; &quot;Bran,&quot; &quot;B.&quot; Years of documented conversations. Photos of him as Brandy, always female, always athletic, always this person he had never been.</p>
<p>&quot;It rewrote me,&quot; Brad said quietly, his voice hollow. &quot;Because we said I was your sister. Because we told them I was a fitness instructor. And then you complained about me making them suspicious. Reality made it true. I&#39;m not Brad anymore. Not to anyone except us.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad looked at his phone again. Female. Brandy. A sister he never was. A life he never lived. But everyone remembered it that way. Everyone except him.</p>
<p>Fury built in his chest.</p>
<p>&quot;This is your fault,&quot; he said, voice shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is YOUR FAULT! Your desperate need to make everyone like you-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was trying to save the dinner!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You erased me! I&#39;m not even Brad anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You erased yourself! You&#39;re the one who came out of your room!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you were FAILING!&quot; Brad was yelling now, all the stress and fear and changes exploding out as rage. &quot;You were wearing OVEN MITTS to hide your nails! You looked like an idiot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was handling it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were NOT handling it!&quot;</p>
<p>They were both yelling, faces inches apart, years of sibling rivalry and recent trauma combining into pure fury.</p>
<p>&quot;At least you still have your REAL NAME!&quot; Brad shouted, voice breaking. &quot;My entire life got erased!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it&#39;s not even fair!&quot; Brad gestured wildly at Alex. &quot;Everyone still thinks you&#39;re a man! You&#39;re still Alex! How is that fair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s ridiculous!&quot; Brad was beyond rational thought now, the unfairness of it all pouring out. &quot;Just look at you! The blonde hair, the blouse, the nails, the heels-nobody&#39;s going to believe you&#39;re a man anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>The words hung in the air.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s eyes widened as he realized what he&#39;d said. &quot;Wait. No. I didn&#39;t mean-&quot;</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>Reality rippled again. Stronger this time. They both felt it washing over them like a wave, changing things, adjusting things, rewriting things.</p>
<p>Alex pulled out his phone with shaking fingers. Social media: Alexis Tate. All pronouns changed to she/her. Comments from coworkers using &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot; and &quot;Alexis.&quot; Email signature: Alexis Tate, Creative Director. Everything.</p>
<p>They both turned to look at the family photos again.</p>
<p>The photos had changed once more.</p>
<p>Now they showed their parents with two daughters. Alexis, platinum blonde and delicate. Brandy, brunette and athletic. Two sisters growing up together. No sons. No brothers. Just two girls in matching dresses, in family portraits, in birthday parties and graduations and all the documented moments of childhood.</p>

<p>They stood in the hallway, both transformed, both erased, both rewritten into people they had never been. The only witnesses to what they had actually been were each other.</p>
<p>The house settled around them with a creak. The 1970s d&eacute;cor bore silent, earth-toned witness. The pot roast, somehow, sat on the kitchen counter-perfectly cooked, beautifully browned, like it had never been burned at all.</p>
<p>Reality had adjusted. Everything was normal now.</p>
<p>To everyone but them.</p>
