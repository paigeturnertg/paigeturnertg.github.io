        <p class="drop-cap">NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong>&nbsp;Previously on Tits for Tates: The sisters went on a date with twins who were no longer twins in the female sense. And somewhere between the cosmos and the cologne, Lexi and Brittany discovered they were now attracted to men. Whether they wanted to be or not. Tonight, on the season finale: An elevator. A fight. And thirty complaints that end everything.</p>

                <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
  
        <p>The research had taken all night. Partly because finding supernatural lawyers on the internet was harder than it sounded, and partly because Lexi couldn't stop thinking about Fredrik's mouth on hers.</p>

        <p>They'd stayed at the club until 1am. Danced. Let the twins buy more drinks. Let them pull them close in the booth. Let them kiss them. Actual kissing, with tongue and hands and the kind of heat that made everything else disappear. Felt attraction that was completely real and completely wrong and completely impossible to fight.</p>

        <p>When Fredrik suggested going back to his place around 12:30, Lexi had almost said yes. Would have said yes, if Brittany hadn't grabbed her hand under the table and squeezed hard enough to hurt. Brittany was right. If they let things go further, eventually the twins would realize that they weren&rsquo;t fully women, at least not down there below the waist where dates between attractive twentysomethings often led.</p>

        <p>They'd made excuses. Promises to text soon. Extracted themselves from the booth and the twins' arms and made it to an Uber that felt like a getaway car.</p>

        <p>They hadn't spoken the entire ride home. Hadn't spoken when they reached the house. Had retreated to separate rooms with the mutual understanding that they'd both nearly crossed a line they couldn't uncross.</p>

        <p>So Lexi researched instead of sleeping. Poured her panic into Google searches and blog posts and increasingly desperate inquiries until she found page forty-seven of a Reddit thread titled "Magical Contracts - Real Stories or Urban Legends?" which had led her down a rabbit hole that eventually pointed to a name:&nbsp;<strong>Solomon Winters, Esq.</strong></p>

        <p><em>Supernatural Law. Paranormal Contract Disputes. Curses, Hexes, and Binding Agreements. Available by appointment only.</em></p>
  
        <p>The website looked like it had been designed in 1997 and forgotten about. But the testimonials were promising, if deeply weird.&nbsp;<em>"Mr. Winters got me out of a deal with a crossroads demon. Five stars!"</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>"Successfully broke my grandmother's curse. Would recommend!"</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>"Helped me terminate a blood oath. Very professional."</em></p>

        <p>It was either real or the most elaborate scam on the internet. At this point, Lexi was willing to try anything.</p>

        <p>Brittany had stumbled into the kitchen at 6:23am, hungover and searching for the coffeemaker, her hair still perfect in her high ponytail. She found Lexi hunched over her laptop like it contained the secrets of the universe.</p>

        <p>"I found someone," Lexi said without preamble. "A lawyer. He specializes in magical contracts."</p>

        <p>"That's a thing?"</p>

        <p>"Apparently. Maybe. Whatever, I&rsquo;m willing to try anything at this point. Before I go on another date with a man."</p>

        <p>They'd called at 9am, the earliest the website said to contact. A receptionist with a voice that suggested she'd seen some things answered and scheduled them for 10:30am.</p>

        <p>Now they stood in the lobby of an office building downtown, the kind of building that had been nice in 1982 and had been coasting on that reputation ever since. Marble floors that had seen better decades. Elevators with brass that needed polishing. A directory board that still used those little plastic letters you had to slide in by hand.</p>

        <p><strong>Suite 1847: WINTERS &amp; ASSOCIATES - SUPERNATURAL LAW</strong></p>

        <p>They stepped into the elevator. Lexi pressed 18. The doors closed with the kind of mechanical wheeze that suggested the elevator was held together by optimism and outdated safety codes.</p>

        <p>They stood on opposite sides of the elevator car, as far apart as six feet of space allowed. The awkward silence was heavy enough to have its own gravitational pull.</p>
        
        <p>"So," Brittany said finally. "Last night was&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"We're not talking about last night."</p>

        <p>"I'm just saying, the way you were looking at Fredrik&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"We're NOT talking about it."</p>

        <p>The elevator climbed. Floor numbers ticked by. 7... 8... 9...</p>

        <p>Brittany shifted her weight, adjusting her high-waisted leggings with strategic mesh cutouts along the thighs. She&rsquo;d grabbed a matching set: mint green sports bra and shorts from Gymshark, then added a top because even she knew you couldn't meet a lawyer in just a sports bra. The shirt was cropped, naturally, perpetually slid off one shoulder, and had "SLAY ALL DAY" printed across the chest in rose gold letters. Her entire wardrobe had transformed into variations on this theme, matching sets in jewel tones, leggings with cutouts and mesh panels, sports bras that were more fashion statement than function, crop tops with motivational phrases. Everything designed to be both workout-ready and Instagram-worthy.</p>

        <p>Lexi wore high-waisted jeans that hugged every curve, a cropped pink sweater that showed a strip of midriff, and ankle boots with a modest heel. Her hair was styled in loose waves, her makeup perfectly applied. The kind of outfit a twenty-four-year-old woman would wear when she wanted to look cute but also put-together. Her closet was full of similar outfits now&mdash;trendy pieces from fast fashion brands, things designed to catch attention.</p>

        <p>11... 12... 13...</p>

        <p>"Do you think he can actually help?" Brittany asked.</p>

        <p>"I don't know. Maybe. If any of this is even real."</p>

        <p>"It's real. We're living it."</p>

        <p>"I know we're living it. I mean if he's real. If supernatural lawyers are actually a thing or if we're about to waste a consultation fee on someone who's going to tell us to sage the house and think positive thoughts."</p>

        <p>14... 15... 16...</p>

        <p>The elevator lurched.</p>

        <p>Stopped.</p>

        <p>The lights flickered once, twice, then stabilized at a dim glow. The floor number display showed nothing. They were stuck between 16 and 17, the liminal space between floors where elevators go to die.</p>

        <p>"No," Lexi said. "No no no, not now."</p>

        <p>Brittany jabbed the button for 18. Nothing happened. She tried the button for the lobby. Still nothing. The door-open button. The alarm. The emergency call button.</p>

        <p>None of them responded.</p>

        <p>"We're stuck," Brittany said.</p>

        <p>"I can see that."</p>

        <p>"In an elevator."</p>

        <p>"Yes, Brittany. We're stuck in an elevator. Thank you for that astute observation. Very helpful."</p>

        <p>They stood there in the dim light, trapped in six feet of metal and poor maintenance, and felt the weight of what this meant settling over them like a blanket made of doom.</p>

        <p>Stuck together. In an enclosed space. Unable to escape.</p>

        <p>"Don't talk," Lexi said. "Just&mdash;don't."</p>

        <p>Silence stretched between them. Seconds became a minute. One minute became two.</p>

        <p>The elevator was quiet except for a faint mechanical hum that suggested something was working but probably shouldn't be. The air was stale. The temperature was climbing. Not dramatically, but enough to notice. Enough to make the space feel smaller.</p>

        <p>Brittany tried to lean quietly against the wall, but she was full of energy that had nowhere to go. Her ponytail swung forward, and she pushed it back. Crossed her arms. Uncrossed them. Shifted her weight from one foot to the other.</p>

        <p>"Can you stand still?" Lexi said.</p>

        <p>"I'm just&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"You're fidgeting. Can you not fidget?"</p>

        <p>"It's not like I'm doing it on purpose."</p>

        <p>"Well, it's distracting."</p>

        <p>Brittany went still. Stared at the elevator doors. Counted to ten. Made it to eight before the words started bubbling up. "You know what this is, right?"</p>

        <p>"What what is?"</p>

        <p>"This. The stuck elevator. Us trapped together. It's a bottle episode."</p>

        <p>"A what?"</p>

        <p>"A bottle episode. It's when a show&mdash;you know, when they have a limited budget or need to save money, so they do an episode that takes place in one location with just the main characters. Like that Community episode where they're all stuck in the study room, or the one from Friends where they're all late to Ross's thing, or that episode of Cheers where&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"Can you STOP?" Lexi's voice rose, frustration exploding out. "Can you stop with the constant sitcom commentary?! Every single thing that happens, you have to&mdash;you have to make it about some TV show! We're trapped in an elevator and our lives are falling apart and it is literally the most annoying thing about you!"</p>

        <p>The words echoed in the small space.</p>

        <p>Silence.</p>

        <p>Then reality hiccupped.</p>

        <p>Brittany felt it immediately. Something in her head shifting, reorganizing, like files being moved in a cabinet she couldn't access. Information disappearing. Knowledge vanishing. Preferences realigning.</p>

        <p>Cheers. Friends. Community. Seinfeld. The names she&rsquo;d just said meant nothing now. Empty words. She tried to remember plots, episodes, characters. Nothing. The entire catalog of classic sitcoms that had been her obsession, her comfort, her coping mechanism for three years after Hannah died, just... gone.</p>

        <p>Replaced by something else. Something brighter, louder, more immediate.</p>

        <p>She could tell you everything about the last three seasons of The Bachelor. Who went home in week four. Which couple had the controversial Fantasy Suite decision. She knew about the Kardashians. All of them, their relationships, their businesses, their latest feuds. Love Island drama. Real Housewives franchises in seven cities. Every celebrity breakup and makeup in the last six months.</p>

        <p>Reality TV. Celebrity gossip. Pop culture in its most immediate, disposable form.</p>

        <p>But sitcoms? The thing that had defined her for years? Blank. Empty. Gone.</p>

        <p>"What did you do?" Brittany's voice shook. "What did you DO to me?"</p>

        <p>Lexi stared at her, realizing too late what she'd triggered. "I didn't mean&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"I can't&mdash;" Brittany grabbed her head with both hands. "Seinfeld. Say something about Seinfeld."</p>

        <p>"What?"</p>

        <p>"Just say something about the show! Any episode! The one with&mdash;"</p>

        <p>Nothing. The show was a blank space where knowledge used to be.</p>

        <p>"Oh my god," Brittany whispered. "You took it. You took all of it."</p>

        <p>"I didn't know that would&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"You took the only thing I had left!" Brittany's voice cracked, tears forming. "After Hannah died, that was all I had! Those shows, those stupid shows, they were&mdash;they were safe! They were predictable! And you just&mdash;"</p>

        <p>Fury replaced devastation. Pure, incandescent rage at what had been stolen.</p>

        <p>"Fine," Brittany said, her voice cold. "You want to hurt me? Let's hurt each other."</p>

        <p>She looked at Lexi with calculation, searching for something that would land. Something that would hurt just as much.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lexi begged. &ldquo;No, please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>"Your advertising career," Brittany said slowly, clearly. "Is so boring."</p>

        <p>Reality reached out again.</p>

        <p>Lexi felt the change happening. Memories shifting. Her degree from Northwestern, gone. The campaigns she'd led, erased. The awards she'd won, disappeared. McMann &amp; Tate, the agency she'd worked at, the respect she'd earned, all of it simply ceased to exist.</p>

        <p>Replaced by something new. Smaller. Less.</p>

        <p>She'd never gone into advertising. Never climbed that corporate ladder. She'd gotten an associate's degree in cosmetology and taken a job as a receptionist at Bella Vista Salon &amp; Spa making $15 an hour answering phones and booking appointments for women who had the careers she'd never have.</p>

        <p>"You bitch," Lexi hissed. "You absolute&mdash;"</p>

        <p>She looked at Brittany, searching for something equally devastating. Found it in the analytical mind that had made Brad good at his job, that had let him write detailed analyses of sitcom structure and cultural impact.</p>

        <p>"You're too smart for your own good," Lexi said, the words sharp as knives.</p>

        <p>Brittany felt her intelligence drain away like water through a sieve. Not all of it&mdash;she could still think, still function&mdash;but the sharp analytical edge was gone. The ability to see patterns, to analyze structure, to think critically about narrative and theme and meaning. All of it smoothed away into something simpler. Easier. Less.</p>

        <p>She could tell you about the Kardashians. Could remember workout routines and meal prep schedules. Could calculate macros and design fitness programs. But ask her to analyze anything deeper than surface level, and there was just... nothing there.</p>

        <p>The ditzy fitness instructor. The bubbly gym girl. Brittany the airhead.</p>

        <p>"You made me stupid," Brittany said, her voice small and horrified. "You made me&mdash;"</p>

        <p>"You took my career!" Lexi shouted back.</p>

        <p>"You took my BRAIN!"</p>

        <p>They stood there, both breathing hard, both furious and devastated and ready to keep going.</p>

        <p>Because that's what they did. That's what they'd always done. One hurt, the other hurt back, forever and ever, tit for tat until there was nothing left.</p>

        <p>"You know what?" Brittany said, her new vapid voice making the cruelty somehow worse. "It was always so pathetic. How you couldn't make a marriage last. Two tries and you still couldn't keep anyone interested. You don&rsquo;t care about marriage enough."</p>

        <p>The change was immediate and comprehensive.</p>

        <p>Lexi's ambitions dissolved completely. She'd never wanted a career, that was absurd. What she wanted, what she'd always wanted, was to find the right man. Get married. Be a wife. That was the goal. The only goal that mattered.</p>

        <p>Her clothes shifted on her body. The trendy clothes reformed, merging into a pale pink fit-and-flare dress that cinched at her waist and flared over her hips, hitting at mid-thigh. Her ankle boots transformed into nude heels with a modest height. She was a picture of perfect, classic femininity.</p>

        <p>She'd been working at the salon for three years, and every day was just another opportunity to meet someone. Every male customer was evaluated as potential husband material. Every conversation was an audition. Her apartment was covered in bridal magazines. Her Pinterest was nothing but wedding boards. Her every thought oriented around finding him, marrying him, becoming Mrs. Someone.</p>

        <p>Lexi felt the shift and recognized what she'd become. Saw herself from the outside for one horrible moment before the new thoughts settled in and made it feel normal.</p>

        <p>"At least I'm trying to find someone!" she shot back, her breathy voice shaking with fury. Her eyes scanned Brittany&rsquo;s body, looking for the easy target. The obvious attack. "Your boobs are too small to land a man anyway!"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Brittany felt the change in her chest immediately. Her modest breasts began to swell. Not dramatically at first, but steadily, filling out the fabric, pushing against the compression. They kept growing, became heavier, fuller, until the sports bra was straining and her cleavage threatened to escape its confines.</p>

        <p>She looked down at her new chest&mdash;probably a D cup, maybe larger&mdash;and felt the weight of them throwing off her center of balance.</p>

        <p>"Oh yeah?" Brittany shot back, because subtlety was dead and they were in the nuclear options now. "Well YOUR boobs are too small too!"</p>

        <p>Lexi's chest swelled to match. Her modest bust filled out rapidly, pushing against her dress, the fabric straining. She felt the weight pulling at her shoulders, the way her posture had to adjust.</p>

        <p>They stared at each other's transformed chests with matching expressions of horror and rage.</p>

        <p>"You know what your problem is?" Lexi said, breathing hard. "You hide. You always cover up. You have this rockin' bod and you just&mdash;you waste it wearing those stupid hoodies!"</p>

        <p>Brittany's workout clothes transformed instantly. Her leggings shrank shorter and shorter until they turned into booty shorts that barely covered anything. The oversized white top evaporated off her body in a wisp of smoke. The sports bra remained&mdash;mint green with thin straps and a plunging V-neck that showed off her enlarged chest&mdash;but now it was the only thing covering her top half. The fabric was minimal, decorative rather than functional, the kind of thing worn for aesthetics rather than actual support.</p>

        <p>"At least I HAVE a body to show off!" Brittany shouted, gesturing at her exposed midriff and barely-covered chest. "You&mdash;you've got no ass! It's completely flat!"</p>

        <p>Lexi felt her rear expand immediately. Her relatively modest behind pushed outward, rounded, became a pronounced bubble butt that made her jeans, already very tight, border on the obscene. The kind of butt that would make sitting in her receptionist chair an adventure in spatial awareness.</p>

        <p>The sisters were both breathing hard now. Both transformed. Both furious. Both unable to stop. But what else remained to be changed?</p>

        <p>"You&mdash;" Lexi started, then stopped. Searched for the next insult. The next wound to inflict. Found the worst one possible. "You're not even a REAL woman!"</p>

        <p>Time seemed to freeze.</p>

        <p>Brittany felt it immediately. The tucking she'd been doing for days&mdash;hiding herself in the tight leggings, keeping everything compressed and invisible&mdash;suddenly became unnecessary. Her penis pulled inward, inverting, reconfiguring. Testicles drew up into her body, transformed into ovaries. The whole structure folded in on itself and reformed from the inside out. A vagina opened where there had been external anatomy. Internal structures bloomed, uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix. Everything reorganizing, rewiring, becoming something completely different. The sensation was overwhelming, visceral, like her entire pelvis was churning, its contents twisting into a new form.</p>

        <p>She was, without a doubt, anatomically female now.</p>

        <p>Horror washed over her face. She looked down at herself, feeling the absence, the difference, the completeness of what had just happened.</p>

        <p>"NEITHER ARE YOU!" Brittany screamed, her voice breaking.</p>

        <p>Lexi felt the same transformation hit her. Her penis inverted, pulled inward, reconfigured itself. Internal structures formed, everything female. The reorganization was complete in seconds, her entire anatomy rewritten.</p>

        <p>They stood there in the elevator, both fully female now, both staring at each other in absolute horror at what they'd just done.</p>

        <p>"Wait&mdash;" Lexi's voice was barely a whisper. "Something&rsquo;s different."</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, we just wished away our dicks.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;No, not that. I feel weird.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Brittany nodded slowly, starting to feel it too. "The complaints. How many was that?"</p>

        <p>"I don't know. I lost count. Twenty-eight? Twenty-nine?"</p>

        <p>"Was that thirty?"</p>

        <p>"I think&mdash;" Lexi's eyes widened. "I think that was thirty."</p>

        <p>The elevator lurched.</p>

        <p>Started moving again.</p>

        <p>Numbers began ticking up on the display: 17... 18...</p>

        <p>"Wait," Brittany said. "The contract said thirty complaints each. If that was&mdash;"</p>

        <p>The elevator dinged.</p>

        <p>The lights went out.</p>

        <p><strong>[CUT TO BLACK]</strong></p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        
        <p>On the twentieth floor, the elevator doors opened.</p>

        <p>Two women stepped out into the hallway, looking around with mild confusion.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"This is weird," the brunette said, checking her phone. "I don't even remember getting in the elevator?"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The blonde adjusted her designer handbag. "Me either. Brain fog. I think I need more sleep."&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A receptionist looked up from her desk. "Ms. Tate? And Ms. Tate? You're here for the ten-thirty appointment with Mr. Morris?"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>They both turned. "Maybe?"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Right down the hall, conference room B."</p>

        <p>They exchanged a glance. The blonde one spoke first. "Thank you. Sorry, I'm just... do you know what this appointment is about? Aren&rsquo;t we meeting with Solomon Winters?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, Mr. Winters is on the eighteenth floor, hon. Supernatural law. This is Morris &amp; Associates. Estate law. Your parents&rsquo; house sale."</p>

        <p>The brunette one pulled out her phone. "Oh! She&rsquo;s right. Says so here in my calendar."</p>

        <p>If Brittany still knew anything about sitcoms&mdash;which she didn't, because that knowledge had been stripped from her fifteen minutes ago in an elevator between floors&mdash;she would have immediately recognized what her sister Lexi had become. The bright blonde hair with golden highlights, carefully styled in loose waves. The overdeveloped chest and bubble butt filling out clothes designed to attract attention. The breathy voice. The obsession with appearance and marriage and finding the right husband.</p>

        <p>A June Cleaver in waiting. The 1950s sitcom housewife born seventy years too late. Appearance-obsessed, marriage-focused, dressed in trendy clothes and desperate to become Mrs. Someone.</p>

        <p>And Brittany would have realized what she had become, as well. The honey-and-caramel highlighted brown hair pulled back in its permanent high ponytail. The skimpy mint green sports bra with its plunging V-neck and matching booty shorts. The enlarged chest and athletic body on display with almost no fabric covering either. The vapid expression. The way she kept checking Instagram stories about reality TV drama. The ditziness that had replaced analytical thinking.</p>

        <p>Chrissy Snow. The Three's Company airhead. The bubbly, dim fitness instructor in revealing workout gear who could tell you about celebrity gossip but couldn't analyze her way out of a paper bag.</p>

        <p>Two female sitcom archetypes, made flesh.</p>

        <p>They found the right office&mdash;MORRIS &amp; ASSOCIATES, ESTATE LAW&mdash;and were ushered into a conference room by a paralegal who seemed completely unsurprised by their arrival.</p>

        <p>An older man in a suit that had seen better days greeted them. "Ms. Tate, Ms. Tate. Good to see you. I have all the paperwork ready for you to sign."</p>

        <p>"Paperwork?" Lexi asked, confused.</p>

        <p>"For your parents' house?" He pulled out a folder. "The sale went through last week. We're here to sign the final documents and establish the trust."</p>

        <p>They sat down, still confused, still feeling like something was wrong but unable to identify what.</p>

        <p>The lawyer explained it patiently: As their parents had commanded in their will, they'd tried living together for a few weeks, sharing the house they&rsquo;d grown up in. It hadn't worked out. &ldquo;Incompatible,&rdquo; the lawyer said kindly. Too much history. Too many differences. They'd decided to sell, split the proceeds, put the money in a trust.</p>

        <p>None of this felt familiar to the Tates, but all of it felt true. The memories were there, hazy but present. They'd fought constantly during those few weeks living together. Argued about everything. Couldn't make it work. Had been relieved when the house sold and they could go their separate ways.</p>

        <p>The lawyer pushed papers across the desk. "Just sign here, and here, and here. The trust is set up to mature when you both turn twenty-five. Until then, you'll both receive a modest monthly allowance from the principal."</p>

        <p>Lexi signed her name in looping feminine script.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>As Brittany reached for the pen, she paused. Stared at the document. Something about the words "living together" made her head hurt. Like trying to remember a dream that was already fading.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Did we..." she started, then stopped. "Never mind."&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Did we what?" Lexi asked.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"I just... had this weird thought. Like we used to&mdash;" Brittany shook her head. "Nothing. Just d&eacute;j&agrave; vu."&nbsp;</p>

        <p>But as she signed her name&mdash;a bubbly signature with a heart over the 'i'&mdash;she could have sworn for just a second that her handwriting used to looked different. Sharper. More masculine. More like...&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The thought dissolved before she could catch it.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"You okay?" Lexi asked. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Yeah," Brittany smiled, the feeling already gone. "Just tired. Probably hungover from last night."</p>

        <p>"You know," the lawyer said, gathering the papers, "it&rsquo;s too bad you couldn&rsquo;t have worked it out and lived together. It's a nice place. Plenty of room for two people."</p>

        <p>Lexi and Brittany looked at each other.</p>

        <p>Lexi felt something&mdash;a strange sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, like she'd heard this suggestion before. Like there was something familiar about the idea of living with her sister in a house that smelled like the 1970s.</p>

        <p>But that was silly. She'd only agreed to live with Brittany for those few weeks to satisfy the will. They were sisters, sure, and they loved each other in that complicated way sisters did. But live together? Room together? Share space full-time?</p>

        <p>Preposterous.</p>

        <p>They were too different. Lexi was focused on finding a husband, building a life, maybe starting a family. She worked at the salon, went on dates, dreamed of wedding venues.</p>

        <p>Brittany taught aerobics classes, posted gym selfies, dated casually, watched reality TV, and seemed perfectly happy living in the moment without worrying about the future.</p>

        <p>They met for brunch once a month. Texted occasionally. Had dinner on holidays. That was enough. That was healthy. That was what sisters did when they loved each other but recognized they weren't compatible.</p>

        <p>"No," Lexi said, and she was smiling as she said it&mdash;not bitterly, not sadly, just... matter-of-factly. "We're better off separate."</p>

        <p>"Definitely," Brittany agreed. "Like, we love each other? But we'd drive each other crazy."</p>

        <p>The lawyer nodded, understanding. "Fair enough. Well, congratulations. You're all set."</p>

        <p>They left the office together, rode the elevator down in comfortable silence, walked out onto the street into sunshine that felt almost aggressive in its cheerfulness.</p>

        <p>On the sidewalk, they hugged goodbye. A real hug, warm and genuine and uncomplicated by resentment or competition or years of tit-for-tat retaliation that they couldn't remember.</p>

        <p>"Text me!" Brittany said. "We should grab brunch soon!"</p>

        <p>"Definitely! And let me know how that date goes!"</p>

        <p>"Oh my god, I will! Did you see what he posted on Instagram? His arms are, like,&nbsp;<em>insane</em>."</p>

        <p>They chatted for another minute about the date, about their plans, about nothing in particular. The easy conversation of people who were related but not close. Who met for holidays and texted occasionally and loved each other in the uncomplicated way you love someone who's never really hurt you.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Because how could they hurt each other? They barely knew each other.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Okay, I gotta run," Brittany said, checking her phone. "I have a client at two."&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Yeah, go! I'll text you!"</p>

        <p>Brittany pulled out her phone. "Wait, we need a pic! C'mere!"</p>

        <p>They posed together on the sidewalk&mdash;Brittany with her arm around Lexi's shoulders, both of them tilting their heads together, Brittany holding the phone up high to get the angle right. The kind of selfie sisters took a thousand times, documented on Instagram stories and camera rolls and group chats.</p>

        <p>"Cute!" Brittany said, already adding a filter. Her thumb flew across the screen, typing a caption.&nbsp;<em>brunch date with my fave sister</em>&nbsp;followed by three pink hearts. Posted to her story before they'd even separated.</p>

        <p>"Love you!"&nbsp;</p>

        <p>"Love you too!"</p>

        <p>They separated, each heading toward their cars, their apartments, their separate lives.</p>

        <p>Lexi walked three blocks before she stopped on the sidewalk, suddenly unsure why she felt so hollow. Like she'd just said goodbye to someone important. Like something had ended that she couldn't remember beginning.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>She pulled out her phone, almost called Brittany, but for what? To say what?&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The feeling passed. Probably just hungover. She kept walking.</p>

        <p>Across town, in a house that had just sold for slightly under asking price, afternoon light filtered through orange curtains onto avocado green carpet. The wood paneling absorbed the silence. A macram&eacute; owl hung on the wall, its knotted eyes fixed on nothing.</p>

        <p>Two brothers had lived here once. Fought here. Changed here. Destroyed each other here one complaint at a time until there was nothing left to destroy.</p>

        <p>But no one remembered that now. The only witnesses were walls that couldn't speak and a textile owl that had seen everything and would tell no one.</p>

        <p>The contract was satisfied. Thirty complaints each. Incompatibility confirmed. Termination complete.</p>

        <p>Whether that was mercy or cruelty, the owl couldn't say.</p>

        <p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong>&nbsp;And so ends the tale of the Tate brothers who became the Tate sisters. Alex and Brad are gone. In their place, two women who never had to survive forty years of toxic sibling rivalry. Two women who can hug goodbye without grudges. Two women who text occasionally and meet for brunch once a month and love each other in that pleasant, uncomplicated way.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Is that better? Is forgetting forty years of someone a kindness or a tragedy? Are they happier now, or have they simply lost the capacity to be unhappy with each other? Did the contract punish them—or save them?</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for watching Tits for Tates. See you in reruns!</p>
