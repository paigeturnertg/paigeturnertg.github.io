          The opposition research started arriving three months into the campaign. Anonymous tips, leaked documents, whispered rumors—all the standard tools of modern political warfare. But this time, the attacks had a sharper edge. Someone was digging into Yvonne's background, and they were getting uncomfortably close to the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We need to talk about damage control," David said, his expression grim as he spread a series of documents across the conference table. "Someone's been making inquiries at the transformation clinic. Asking questions about recent patients, medical procedures, confidentiality agreements."
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne felt her stomach drop. She'd known this moment might come, but she'd hoped they'd make it to election day before the truth emerged. "How much do they know?"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Nothing concrete yet. Dr. Winters' NDAs are solid, and the clinic's patient privacy protections are extensive. But someone's clearly suspicious. We need to decide how to handle this if it breaks publicly."
        </p>

        <figure class="blog-post__figure">
          <a href="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg">
            <div class="hero__image-wrapper" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;">
              <img src="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg" alt="Crisis management meeting" class="hero__image" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 1.25rem;" loading="lazy">

          </a>
          <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">Planning for the worst-case scenario</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The legal implications were staggering. Yvonne ran through the scenarios in her mind—fraud allegations, identity questions, campaign finance irregularities. Even if they'd technically stayed within the letter of the law, the optics would be devastating. "Candidate undergoes biological transformation to win voters" wasn't exactly a headline that inspired confidence in authentic leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We could get ahead of it," Yvonne suggested, though the words felt hollow even as she spoke them. "Control the narrative by telling the story ourselves. Frame it as innovative campaign strategy rather than deception."
        </p>

        <p>
          David shook his head. "The polling data on that is brutal. Focus groups see it as manipulation, not innovation. Even our strongest supporters would feel betrayed. If this comes out, we're done."
        </p>

        <p>
          So they were trapped in a high-stakes game of chicken, hoping the truth stayed buried long enough for them to win an election that was based on a fundamental deception. Yvonne had spent her legal career arguing about truth and justice, and now she was counting on lies by omission to change the course of history.
        </p>

        <p>
          The irony would be funny if it weren't so terrifying.
