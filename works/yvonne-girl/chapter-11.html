          The debate stage was bright enough to make Yvonne's eyes water, but she'd trained for this. Three months of preparation, mock debates, rapid-fire policy briefings—all leading to this moment where she'd face the incumbent senator under the scrutiny of millions of viewers. Style versus substance, optics versus ideas, and she had to master both.
        </p>

        <p>
          Senator Richard Harmon looked exactly like what central casting would send for "experienced politician"—silver hair, expensive suit, the practiced smile of someone who'd won six elections. He'd underestimated Yvonne in the early polls, dismissing her as a political novice. But the recent surge in her numbers had clearly rattled him.
        </p>

        <p>
          "My opponent is long on rhetoric and short on experience," Harmon said during his opening statement, deploying the attack line his team had clearly tested extensively. "Leadership requires more than talking points and manufactured outrage. It requires years of proven results."
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne felt the familiar rush of courtroom combat, the same energy that had driven her through dozens of high-stakes legal arguments. "Senator Harmon is right that leadership requires results," she countered. "Which is why voters are asking what he's done with his eighteen years in office besides accumulate corporate PAC donations and vote against their interests."
        </p>

        <p>
          The exchange escalated from there—healthcare costs, infrastructure investment, climate policy. On every issue, Yvonne found herself deploying the legal expertise she'd spent years developing, combined with the relatability that her transformation had supposedly unlocked. She was wielding substance with style, and she could see from Harmon's increasingly flustered responses that it was working.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You speak in generalities," Harmon tried, but Yvonne was ready with specific legislative references, budget numbers, policy details that showed she'd done her homework. This wasn't manufactured competence—this was the real expertise she'd always possessed, finally being heard because it came wrapped in packaging voters found acceptable.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the debate moderator called time, Yvonne realized something had shifted. She wasn't performing authenticity anymore. The substance was real, the passion was genuine, and somewhere along the way, she'd stopped feeling like an imposter. The transformation had opened doors, but what she did once she walked through them—that was all her.
