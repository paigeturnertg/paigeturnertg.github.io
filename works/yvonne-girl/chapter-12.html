          The final week of the campaign blurred into a montage of handshakes, speeches, and last-minute media appearances. The polls showed Yvonne and Senator Harmon in a statistical dead heat, with undecided voters holding the keys to victory. Every appearance mattered. Every word could tip the balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the Saturday before Election Day, Yvonne found herself at a photo opportunity that would become iconic—helping rebuild homes damaged by recent flooding in rural Ohio. She wasn't there for show; she'd rolled up her sleeves and spent genuine hours working alongside volunteers, discussing policy solutions for climate resilience between hammer strikes.
        </p>

        <p>
          A photographer captured the moment: Yvonne mid-swing, tool belt around her waist, mud on her work boots, genuinely engaged with the community members beside her. No staged photo shoot could have manufactured that level of authentic connection.
        </p>

        <figure class="blog-post__figure">
          <a href="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg">
            <div class="hero__image-wrapper" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;">
              <img src="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg" alt="Volunteer work" class="hero__image" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 1.25rem;" loading="lazy">

          </a>
          <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">The photo that would define the final stretch</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The image went viral within hours. "This is what public service looks like," read the social media captions. "Real leadership, not photo ops." The irony wasn't lost on Yvonne—her entire candidacy was the ultimate photo op, a carefully constructed image designed to appeal to specific demographics. Yet somehow, in the process of performing authenticity, she'd found actual moments of genuine connection.
        </p>

        <p>
          By Monday, the tracking polls showed Yvonne pulling ahead by three points. David was cautiously optimistic. The campaign team was exhausted but energized. Everything came down to turnout and those final undecided voters making their choice in the privacy of the voting booth.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Yvonne prepared for her final campaign rally, she caught her reflection in the greenroom mirror. The face looking back was familiar now—she'd inhabited it long enough that it felt like hers. But she wondered what would happen if she won. Would she spend her entire term in office living as someone else? Was the transformation permanent, or would there be a day when she could reclaim her original identity?
        </p>

        <p>
          More importantly, did she even want to go back? She'd accomplished more in these months as the transformed Yvonne than she had in years of behind-the-scenes legal work. Maybe the person she'd become was who she'd always been meant to be. Or maybe that was just what she told herself to justify the deception.
