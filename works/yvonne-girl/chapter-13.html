        <p class="drop-cap">
          The story broke on Election Day morning. "Questions Surround Candidate's Background" read the headline on a conservative news website known for opposition research. The article was carefully written to avoid libel while making maximum insinuations—medical procedures, unexplained gaps in Yvonne's timeline, anonymous sources suggesting something wasn't quite right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne stared at her phone in the back of the campaign van, watching the story spread across social media like wildfire. They'd been so careful, but apparently not careful enough. Someone had connected enough dots to raise questions, even if they didn't have the full picture yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          "How do we respond?" Jamie asked, her usual confidence shaken. "Do we ignore it? Issue a denial? The polls close in twelve hours."
        </p>

        <p>
          David was already on three different phone calls, coordinating rapid response and damage control. But Yvonne knew the legal and political calculus here. A denial would invite deeper investigation. Silence would look like confirmation. And the truth would destroy everything they'd built.
        </p>

          <a href="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg">
            <div class="hero__image-wrapper" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;">
              <img src="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg" alt="Crisis moment" class="hero__image" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 1.25rem;" loading="lazy">

          <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">Election Day crisis</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          "I'll handle this," Yvonne said, making a decision that felt both terrifying and inevitable. "Schedule a press conference for two hours from now. I'm going to tell the truth."
        </p>

        <p>
          The shocked silence in the van was palpable. "Yvonne, you can't—" David started, but she cut him off.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We built this campaign on authenticity, on being different from politicians who hide behind spin and deception. I can't win an election based on the biggest lie of all and claim to represent honest leadership. If the voters reject me because of what I've done, then I don't deserve to win."
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the kind of idealistic statement that political operatives hated, but Yvonne had spent too long as a lawyer to stomach the alternative. You couldn't build a career on truth and justice while your entire identity was a strategic fabrication.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two hours later, she stood in front of cameras and told the story—the transformation, the reasoning, the hope that substance could overcome initial prejudices if given the right packaging. She spoke about the unfairness of a system where the same ideas were rejected or accepted based solely on who delivered them. She acknowledged the deception while defending the authentic passion that had driven every policy proposal and campaign promise.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then she waited to see whether voters cared more about the package or the contents.
