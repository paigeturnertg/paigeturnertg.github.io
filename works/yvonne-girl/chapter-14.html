      <article class="chapter__content">
        <p class="drop-cap">The room felt too small, the walls too close, the air too thick.</p>
<p>I&#39;d been pacing for twenty minutes, wearing a groove in the carpet between the mirror and the door, checking my reflection without really seeing myself. My hands wouldn&#39;t stop shaking. I&#39;d given dozens of high-stakes performances-press conferences where one wrong word could tank poll numbers, crisis briefings where reporters smelled blood in the water, state dinners where I had to charm donors who openly despised everything my boss stood for.</p>
<p>But this felt different. More pivotal.</p>
<p>Music started somewhere beyond the door. Formal, the kind of arrangement that announced Important Political Moment. Through the walls I could hear movement-expensive fabric rustling, whispered conversations, the particular sound of two hundred influential people settling into position to witness something they&#39;d discuss for months afterward.</p>
<p>They were all out there. Every donor who mattered, every political operative who could build or destroy careers, every old money family that had been pulling strings in this state since before I was born. Everyone would be watching. I couldn&#39;t mess this up.</p>
<p>The door opened and a woman in a headset appeared-young, pretty, ambitious, probably some intern just getting started. &quot;Five minutes,&quot; she said with the kind of professional smile that suggested she&#39;d been doing this for twelve hours straight and was fueled entirely by espresso and spite.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>She disappeared. The music swelled before the door muffled it again, thrumming through the walls like a heartbeat that wasn&#39;t mine.</p>
<p>I turned back to the mirror. Casey had promised this would work. Promised I&#39;d have what I needed-political relevance, real power, a place that mattered. All the things I&#39;d been dying without.</p>
<p>All I had to do was walk out there and commit. Say what needed to be said without stumbling. Make it look natural instead of like the calculated transaction it actually was.</p>
<p>Photographers would be positioned throughout the space by now. This moment would be documented, distributed, analyzed by political blogs and social media accounts. Every detail would matter. Every frame would be captured and preserved as evidence-though whether evidence of success or ambition or elaborate fraud depended entirely on who was doing the analyzing.</p>
<p>The door opened again. Headset girl returned, checking her tablet with the focus of someone coordinating military logistics. &quot;We&#39;re ready for you. Governor Rivera is in position. Everyone&#39;s waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>She held the door wider. The music shifted-louder, booming, the notes vibrating through my bones.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s your cue,&quot; she said, gentle enough that I wondered if she could tell I was barely holding it together.</p>
<p>I walked toward the doorway on legs that felt disconnected from my body. The music was almost overwhelming, filling every available space with the promise of something momentous and irreversible.</p>
<p>The doors swung fully open.</p>
<p>The aisle stretched ahead through an elegant cathedral. White roses and pale orchids lined both sides in arrangements so elaborate they&#39;d required a team of florists working since dawn. Two hundred guests rose to their feet in formal attire-faces I recognized from campaign events and fundraisers and political dinners where I used to be the one working the room instead of being the center of attention.</p>
<p>The altar sat at the far end, draped in ivory silk and greenery. And standing there in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, smiling with what looked like genuine affection, stood Michael Rivera.</p>
<p>Waiting for his bride.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p><strong>Two Years Earlier</strong></p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re not going to like it,&quot; Casey had said.</p>
<p>Here it came. The catch, the one thing that Casey wanted in exchange for giving me a path back to political relevance. Though we both knew it didn&#39;t matter what she said next, I was going to agree to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Casey walked to the window overlooking the city. &quot;The governor needs a wife. He&#39;s been able to defy the odds so far, but you and I both know that unmarried men can only go so far in elected office.&quot;</p>
<p>She paused, letting my mind swirl at the implication. &quot;But not just any wife. Someone who appears conventionally female but has&hellip; something extra.&quot;</p>
<p>The words took a moment to penetrate. I stared at her reflection in the window, watching her watch the city lights like she owned them.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>She turned back, expression clinical. &quot;Evan, you already know this. He&#39;s attracted to trans women. Trans women with penises, in particular.&quot;</p>
<p>No judgment in her tone, just data.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not public knowledge, obviously. Can&#39;t be public knowledge if he wants a national career. But it&#39;s also not negotiable for him. He&#39;s had a number of relationships with cis women over the years, they never held his interest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So he wants to marry a trans woman and stay closeted about the specifics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. And lucky for us, I happen to know one.&quot; She laughed. &quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt that he respects you-respects that you understand politics, can advise him on policy, handle public scrutiny with competence. We just need to make sure you meet his very particular personal requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>She moved closer, settling into the chair across from me. &quot;Complete transformation would be required. Facial feminization surgery. Cheekbones, jaw, nose, brow ridge, all of it. Permanently feminine features. Tracheal shave and voice feminization surgery. No one can know you were ever Evan Cross.&quot;</p>
<p>The precision with which she described erasing me made my hands go cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Complete legal identity creation,&quot; she continued, as if she were telling me her weekend plans. &quot;Manufactured background story. All documented and verifiable if anyone checks, which they will. Breast augmentation, body contouring liposuction, the works. New identity, new face, new voice, new body, new legal existence.&quot;</p>
<p>She paused, watching me process.</p>
<p>&quot;No bottom surgery, though. That&#39;s essential to the arrangement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, Casey.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot; She leaned forward. &quot;Of course, we&#39;d let you two get reacquainted first. There would be a courtship period. Public dating, carefully documented by friendly media. Society page coverage, photographs at fundraisers, the whole performance. Then marriage. You&#39;d be his wife, his political partner. Think of it, Evan, you&#39;d have genuine policy influence. You&#39;d be First Lady of the state. Maybe the country, if we play it right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The presidency?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s going national within two years. Senate first if the timing works, but we might skip straight to a presidential run depending on how the landscape develops.&quot; Casey&#39;s smile was sharp as broken glass.</p>
<p>&quot;And you&#39;ll be his Chief of Staff through it all. Managing the administration, controlling access, shaping policy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally. But you&#39;d be a First Lady with genuine influence over his decisions. I guarantee it.&quot;</p>
<p>The offer sat between us like a time bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why would you help me after everything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because despite your spectacular self-destruction, you&#39;re one of the few people who can craft policy that actually works instead of just polling well. Because Rivera&#39;s going to need that expertise and I don&#39;t have time to do both strategy and substance. Because keeping you broken and desperate serves no purpose now that you understand what I&#39;m capable of.&quot; She stood, moved to the bar, poured herself wine without offering me any. &quot;And because this solves multiple problems elegantly. Rivera gets the partner he needs without risking exposure. You get back into politics at the highest level. I get the policy brain I can actually work with instead of the chaos you became.&quot;</p>
<p>She took a sip, studying me over the rim of her glass.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell her to go to hell. Wanted to walk out with whatever dignity I had left and find some other way to survive that didn&#39;t involve surgically altering my face and legally erasing my identity and marrying a man for political access.</p>
<p>But we both knew I had no dignity left. That&#39;s why I was here, sitting in her apartment in the wee hours of a Wednesday morning, listening to her describe her plans to break me into pieces and rebuild me as a politician&#39;s wife.</p>
<p>The alternative was what? More months of delivering liquor to rich people who never learned my name? Watching from the outside while Casey shaped national politics? Living with my father&#39;s permanent disappointment and my own growing certainty that I&#39;d wasted the only thing I was ever good at?</p>
<p>The withdrawal from political relevance had been worse than the hormone withdrawal, worse than losing Casey, worse than any of the humiliation Beau had inflicted. At least when I was Yvonne I&#39;d mattered. People knew my name. My work affected real lives. Now I was nobody.</p>
<p>The calculation was that simple. That cold. That absolutely certain.</p>
<p>&quot;When do we start?&quot; I heard myself say.</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s satisfied smile told me she&#39;d known exactly what I&#39;d choose. She&#39;d always known. &quot;Tomorrow morning,&quot; she said, already pulling out her phone to send off the necessary texts. &quot;A car will pick you up at seven to take you to a private airfield. That&#39;s all you need to know at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That fast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, you have affairs to tie up?&quot; She smirked. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone is going to miss having one less delivery driver in their apps. We have a lot to do. We need to get started.&quot;</p>
<p>She said it with such certainty, like my future was already written and I was just a character following the script she&#39;d prepared.</p>
<p>Maybe I was. Maybe I&#39;d been following her script since the first morning she&#39;d helped me into a dress.</p>
<p>&quot;I need you to understand something,&quot; Casey said, setting down her phone and looking at me directly. &quot;Once we start this, there&#39;s no going back. The surgeries are permanent. The legal identity change is permanent. The marriage will be as permanent as any political marriage can be. You&#39;re not going to wake up one day and decide you want to be Evan Cross again, because Evan Cross will be dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you?&quot; She leaned forward. &quot;Because I need to know you&#39;re committed. That you&#39;re choosing this with full awareness of what you&#39;re trading away. I can&#39;t have you falling apart halfway through.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought about my father&#39;s old advice, about understanding the fictional governor Willie Stark so you could recognize when you&#39;re working for the real version. About knowing when you&#39;ve crossed the line from political pragmatism to personal self-destruction.</p>
<p>I was crossing that line right now, with full awareness, because I&#39;d discovered that some things are worse than being destroyed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m committed,&quot; I said. &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey smiled, and there was something almost like approval in her expression. &quot;Good. Then let&#39;s build you a future.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Nine months later, Dr. Eriksson removed the bandages with the careful precision of someone unwrapping a priceless vase. &quot;Ready to see?&quot;</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t. But I nodded anyway, because what else was I going to say after six weeks of recovery?</p>
<p>The mirror showed a stranger. Refined nose where mine used to be broad and slightly crooked. Sculpted cheekbones that caught light in ways my face never had. Softened jaw, reshaped brow ridge, subtle changes around the eyes that added up to someone completely different. Ethnically ambiguous features that suggested diverse heritage-Latina, maybe Mediterranean-without committing to specifics.</p>
<p>There was no denying it. I was beautiful, in an understated way that wouldn&#39;t overwhelm in photographs. Feminine without being delicate. The kind of face that could handle both formal events and sympathetic close-ups for magazine profiles.</p>
<p>Completely, utterly unrecognizable as Evan Cross. Though to be honest, by the time the surgeons had gotten around to my face, Evan Cross had already been mostly erased.</p>
<p>I&#39;d been smuggled quietly to the nondescript Scandinavian clinic, stepping off the private jet to find a team of specialists waiting to assist me with becoming my &quot;true self.&quot; Everyone was warm, professional, and most importantly, completely discreet. No record of Evan Cross arriving at the clinic would ever exist.</p>
<p>The hormones started immediately. That first injection went into my hip with familiar pressure, the oily burn spreading through muscle. I&#39;d been off estrogen for six months, and my body had started reverting-the softness fading from my skin, curves diminishing as testosterone reasserted itself.</p>
<p>Not that would have to worry about testosterone anymore. Within a day of arrival I&#39;d undergone an orchiectomy. I&#39;d always understood this was a one way street, but that was the moment that sealed it. Male anatomy systematically dissected in a surgical suite while I was unconscious, retaining only what Rivera needed.</p>
<p>I&#39;d woken up from that surgery feeling like something essential had been stolen, even though I&#39;d signed the consent forms myself. The absence was physical and psychological-not just the missing anatomy but the knowledge that testosterone would never kick back in, that my body was now permanently dependent on external hormones to function.</p>
<p>The physical changes came faster the second time. My body remembered how to respond to estrogen, welcomed it back like an old friend. Or maybe it was because I didn&#39;t have balls anymore. Either way, within weeks my chest was tender again, my skin softened, fat redistributing to hips and thighs.</p>
<p>The vocal cord surgery felt like violence against something fundamental. Four weeks of enforced silence while everything healed. Four weeks of communicating through text messages and handwritten notes, of gesturing and pointing like a child who hadn&#39;t learned language yet.</p>
<p>Speaking for the first time after the surgery, the voice that came out was higher, softer, unmistakably feminine, but the pitch alone wasn&#39;t enough. The surgery had changed my vocal cords, but I still sounded like someone whose voice had been surgically altered rather than someone who&#39;d always spoken this way.</p>
<p>The following months of voice coaching fixed that. Learning to use this new instrument with perfect feminine diction and expressiveness. Eliminating the regional accent I&#39;d never noticed I had. Reshaping how I emphasized words, how I ended sentences, how I expressed every thought and emotion. The thousand small adjustments that separated surgical pitch from authentic female speech.</p>
<p>By the end, saying &quot;Evan Cross&quot; in this new voice, with these new patterns, sounded wrong. Like someone mocking the person I used to be.</p>
<p>Breast augmentation took what the hormones had started and made it impossible to ignore. I&#39;d had B-cups from my time as Yvonne-real tissue that had deflated somewhat during the three months off hormones but never disappeared. The high-dose estrogen had brought back their fullness within weeks, but Casey had specified more. Something that would photograph well, be substantial enough to be obvious in any outfit.</p>
<p>I&#39;d gone under anesthesia with modest breasts and woken up with weight on my chest that felt alien and permanent. The implants sat behind my natural tissue, pushing everything forward and up in ways that made my silhouette unmistakably feminine. Surgically enhanced, carefully shaped, undeniably present. C-cups that needed no padding or prosthetics, just expensive bras to shape and display them properly.</p>
<p>The strange disconnect of having a fully female body with male genitalia never quite resolved itself. I&#39;d look in the mirror and see breasts, hips, a feminine waist-and then look down and see what remained. The specific configuration Rivera needed. The reason Casey had orchestrated all of this.</p>
<p>But the identity erasure was more difficult than the physical changes. Bodies heal on their own, but stories only become real if you tell them enough times.</p>
<p>The name arrived by courier on a Wednesday afternoon, three months into the transformation. A folder containing my new birth certificate, social security card, and manufactured paper trail. &quot;Evita Morgan,&quot; the documents read.</p>
<p>I&#39;d never know if Rivera had requested something specifically Latina-coded, or if &quot;Evita&quot; was Casey&#39;s private joke about political wives and their ambitious husbands. Either way, I was now her.</p>
<p>Learning to be Evita meant memorizing a fake childhood until it felt more real than my actual past. Foster care in three different homes between ages six and sixteen. The social worker named Patricia Reyes-now deceased-who&#39;d been kind, who&#39;d encouraged college applications. Bachelor&#39;s degree from a community college where records were easily forged and attendance difficult to verify.</p>
<p>Humanitarian work overseas with NGOs that existed on paper if anyone checked. South Sudan, Guatemala, Honduras. Countries that experienced significant political upheaval, where record-keeping was inconsistent at best. The NGOs were small, under-resourced, and had since dissolved.</p>

        </figure>

<p>During the months as I waited for the hormones to work, for the surgeries to heal, I repeated every detail until I lost count. The stories became smooth, automatic, detailed with each repetition. I could describe Evita&#39;s difficult adolescence better than Evan&#39;s actual one. Could talk about her work in Guatemala more convincingly than my real policy experience. Could recall specific memories of her invented childhood-the smell of Mrs. Patterson&#39;s kitchen in her second foster home, the way Mr. Valdez had looked when he&#39;d told her she had a future, the sound of children laughing in the Guatemalan school where she&#39;d volunteered.</p>
<p>None of it was real. All of it became real through repetition.</p>
<p>Deportment training erased unconscious masculine patterns I didn&#39;t know I had. How I stood-weight distributed differently, hips slightly forward. How I sat-legs crossed at the ankle or knee, never sprawled. How I gestured when I spoke-smaller movements, hands less aggressive in their emphasis. How I walked-from the hips instead of the shoulders, steps shorter, the natural sway created by my hormonally widened hips emphasized rather than suppressed.</p>
<p>I drilled for weeks on feminine mannerisms that needed to look natural instead of performed. The slight head tilt when listening. The softer laugh that came from the throat rather than the belly. The way to accept a compliment without deflecting. The thousand small adjustments that added up to someone new.</p>
<p>The moment I stopped performing femininity and started just being female happened somewhere around month four. I&#39;d been practicing my Evita backstory when I realized I was sitting with my legs crossed at the ankle, hands folded in my lap, head tilted slightly as I spoke. I wasn&#39;t thinking about it anymore. The performance had become automatic enough to pass as authentic.</p>
<p>&quot;There she is,&quot; the coach had said, watching me with satisfaction. &quot;Evita Morgan.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Looking at my surgically altered face in Dr. Eriksson&#39;s mirror now, two weeks after the final procedure, I understood the completeness of it.</p>
<p>Evan Cross was gone. Evita Morgan had a social security number, a driver&#39;s license, a passport, a complete paper trail establishing her existence. Birth certificate from a hospital in Phoenix that had burned down fifteen years ago, conveniently destroying the original records but leaving the state database intact. School transcripts. Employment history. Tax returns showing modest income from NGO work.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael wants to meet you next month,&quot; Casey said over the phone. &quot;We&#39;ll get you back to the States, get you a volunteer job at a local charity. There&#39;s a fundraiser at the Meridian Gallery. I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re both there, arrange the introduction to look organic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Already?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re ready. The transformation is complete. Now we just need to see if the chemistry works.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What if he doesn&#39;t like me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He will.&quot; Casey&#39;s certainty was absolute. &quot;He was infatuated with you as Yvonne. Now you&#39;re exactly what he needs. Beautiful, brilliant, politically sophisticated, and anatomically compatible. The package is perfect. All you have to do is be yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Myself. As if that meant anything anymore.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The Meridian Gallery hummed with the particular energy of wealth gathering to fund ambition. I stepped out of the town car and felt every eye in the vicinity track my movement.</p>
<p>The emerald silk dress fit like it had been tailored for me, instead of the other way around. Corset-style bodice that emphasized the surgical cleavage I&#39;d stopped thinking of as artificial, mid-thigh skirt that showed legs I&#39;d learned to walk on in four-inch Manolo Blahniks without conscious thought. The fabric shifted around my hips with each step, announcing my presence to anyone paying attention.</p>

        <p>And people were definitely paying attention. Men&#39;s eyes followed the dress, the legs, the calculated presentation. I caught my reflection in the gallery&#39;s glass doors-Evita Morgan, fully realized, ready to debut a fabricated identity to a man who knew it was fabricated.</p>
<p>Performance within performance. Lies wrapped in truth wrapped in the desperate need to matter again.</p>
<p>Inside, the state&#39;s wealthiest families circulated between installations they&#39;d never look at twice, discussing politics and business deals while servers distributed champagne.</p>
<p>I spotted Rivera near the buffet, discussing immigration policy with a cluster of donors in expensive suits. When he looked up and saw me approach, something shifted in his expression-recognition, maybe, or simply awareness that Casey&#39;s plan was in motion.</p>
<p>But his smile was genuine. Not calculated, not performing for the room. Actually warm.</p>
<p>I walked toward him, aware of every eye that tracked my approach. The moment before contact-breathe, arrange new face into smile, become Evita.</p>
<p>&quot;Governor Rivera?&quot;</p>
<p>He turned fully, and I watched him take me in. The dress, the face, the complete package Casey had designed to his specifications.</p>
<p>&quot;Have we met?&quot; Performing for anyone watching, giving us plausible deniability about the choreographed nature of this encounter.</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet. Evita Morgan.&quot; I extended my hand. His handshake lingered, warm and solid, and I felt the first flutter of something I didn&#39;t want to examine too closely. &quot;I&#39;ve been following your education reform work. The school funding framework is genuinely innovative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve actually read the proposal?&quot; His eyebrows rose with what looked like genuine surprise. &quot;Most people stop at the executive summary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The executive summary glosses over the interesting parts.&quot; I smiled, deploying charm like a weapon. &quot;Your implementation timeline is aggressive, but the financing structure is elegant. Risky, but brilliant if you can sell it.&quot;</p>
<p>Something shifted in his expression. Interest. Recognition that even if the package had changed, the mind that he&#39;d found so compelling as Yvonne was still inside.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people tell me it&#39;s too complicated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people are idiots.&quot; The words came out sharper than I&#39;d intended, more Evan than Evita, but his laugh suggested I&#39;d judged correctly.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I get you a drink?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;White wine. Dry.&quot;</p>
<p>He signaled a server, and we drifted toward a quieter corner of the gallery. Away from the cluster of donors, close enough that I could smell his cologne.</p>
<p>&quot;So what brings a policy wonk to a fundraiser?&quot; he asked, handing me a glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Curiosity. I wanted to see if you were as interesting in person as you are on paper.&quot; I let my fingers brush his as I accepted the wine. &quot;People aren&#39;t always what they seem from a distance.&quot;</p>
<p>His smile suggested he&#39;d caught the subtext. We were both performing, both aware of it, both curious if something real could exist within the choreography.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they&#39;re not,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Though sometimes the real version is more interesting than the public one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That depends on who&#39;s looking.&quot; I took a sip of wine. &quot;And whether they&#39;re actually paying attention or just seeing what they expect to see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You strike me as someone who pays very close attention.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only to things that interest me.&quot; The flirtation was running underneath now, electricity neither of us was trying very hard to hide. &quot;And you&#39;re very interesting, Governor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michael,&quot; he said. &quot;Please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Michael.&quot; I tested his name in my new voice, watched him watch my mouth form the syllables. &quot;Tell me something true.&quot;</p>
<p>The request caught him off-guard. I could see him weighing what to offer, how much honesty this performance could sustain.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m tired of people who want things from me,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Everyone has an agenda. Everyone&#39;s performing. Sometimes I can&#39;t tell if anyone actually sees me or just the office.&quot;</p>
<p>The vulnerability was real, even if the setting was manufactured. We were both lonely in our different ways-him from being too visible, me from being completely erased and rebuilt.</p>
<p>&quot;I see you,&quot; I said, and meant it in ways he couldn&#39;t fully understand. &quot;The person who actually cares about policy instead of just polling. Who wants to do something that matters instead of just something that wins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you want, Evita?&quot;</p>
<p>The question hung between us, weighted with more meaning than the casual phrasing suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;The same thing,&quot; I said. &quot;To matter. To do work that actually helps people instead of just looking good on TV.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes held mine, searching for something. &quot;You&#39;re not what I expected.&quot;</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t sure what Casey had told him to expect, but the honesty in his voice made my chest ache. He was decent. Genuinely kind. Actually cared even though he knew this was transactional.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither are you,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that good or bad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t decided yet.&quot; I smiled, letting the performance and the truth exist simultaneously. &quot;Ask me again after dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t asked you to dinner yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will.&quot; The confidence came from somewhere-maybe Evita, maybe Evan, maybe the space between them. &quot;You&#39;re curious now. You want to know if this is real or just another performance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And which is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does it matter?&quot; I finished my wine. &quot;Everything in politics is performance. The question is whether we&#39;re good enough actors to make it feel real.&quot;</p>
<p>His laugh was surprised, delighted. &quot;You&#39;re dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only to people who deserve it.&quot; I set down my glass. &quot;I should circulate. People will talk if I monopolize you all evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let them talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#39;t mean that. You&#39;re running for office. You can&#39;t afford scandals.&quot; The word landed deliberately, testing. &quot;Even innocent ones.&quot;</p>
<p>Something flickered in his expression-awareness that I knew more than I should, that this conversation was happening on multiple levels simultaneously.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I get your number?&quot; he asked, pulling out his phone. &quot;I&#39;d like to continue this conversation. Somewhere more private.&quot;</p>
<p>I recited Evita&#39;s number. He typed it in carefully, like the digits mattered more than they should.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll call you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you will.&quot; I touched his arm briefly, felt him respond to the contact. &quot;It was lovely meeting you, Michael.&quot;</p>
<p>Walking away, I felt his eyes following me.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Eight months of carefully choreographed dating followed. What surprised me-what I hadn&#39;t expected-was discovering that Michael Rivera was genuinely smart. Not politician smart, where you memorize talking points and deploy them with charisma. Actually intelligent in ways that made conversations feel like intellectual sparring matches I didn&#39;t want to end.</p>
<p>Our fourth dinner, some Italian place Casey had suggested, I challenged his education funding math. &quot;Your timeline&#39;s too aggressive. You&#39;ll lose rural districts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we frame it as local control.&quot; He was already three moves ahead, knife and fork paused over his osso buco while his mind worked the angles.</p>
<p>&quot;Which you haven&#39;t done in any public statement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I&#39;m waiting for my brilliant policy strategist girlfriend to figure out the messaging.&quot; His smile suggested he knew exactly what he was doing-flattering me while also genuinely wanting my input.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not your strategist. Or your girlfriend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet.&quot; He took a sip of wine, eyes holding mine over the rim of the glass. &quot;But you could be. If you wanted.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>This became our pattern. He&#39;d present policy frameworks over dinner, I&#39;d find the flaws he&#39;d missed or hadn&#39;t wanted to admit existed. I&#39;d suggest approaches, he&#39;d see implications three steps down the line that I&#39;d overlooked. It felt like the best parts of working for Beau without the psychological warfare-two minds that recognized each other, respected each other, genuinely enjoyed the intellectual combat.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re arguing my side better than I did,&quot; he said one evening after I&#39;d spent twenty minutes defending his criminal justice reform bill against my own critique.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s because your side is actually correct. You just presented it badly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So fix it for me.&quot; He reached across the table, fingers finding mine.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>The physical relationship developed within that framework of intellectual connection. His kiss after the sixth date was gentle and tentative, asking permission with his body language before committing.</p>
<p>I kissed him back because that&#39;s what couples did after six dates, what the performance required. It wasn&#39;t unpleasant. His mouth was warm, his hands careful on my waist. I didn&#39;t desire him-men would never do it for me regardless of how many cc&#39;s of hormones the doctors pumped into me. But I didn&#39;t mind it either. After months of isolation and Casey&#39;s systematic neglect, any human touch that wasn&#39;t transactional felt almost comforting.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that for weeks,&quot; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m glad you finally did,&quot; I lied, or maybe didn&#39;t lie. The truth was more complicated than want or don&#39;t want. I was lonely enough that his affection felt good even when it didn&#39;t arouse me.</p>
<p>The physical relationship developed gradually within careful boundaries. His hand on my lower back at events. Fingers intertwined when we walked. Kissing that became more comfortable, less strange, something I could do without thinking too hard about what it meant. Making out on his couch while we watched documentaries, his hands careful about where they wandered, never pushing past what I was willing to give.</p>
<p>&quot;We should wait,&quot; I said one evening when his hands had moved to the buttons of my slacks. &quot;Until after the wedding.&quot;</p>
<p>He pulled back immediately, respect written across his features. &quot;Of course. I didn&#39;t mean to pressure-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re not.&quot; I touched his face, genuine affection mixing with strategic necessity. &quot;I just... I want that to be special. Not rushed.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth was messier. I needed time to prepare myself for what sex with a man would mean, how my body would respond, whether I could sustain the performance in that level of intimacy. The wedding night would be difficult enough without the added complication of disappointing him beforehand.</p>
<p>&quot;I can wait,&quot; he said, kissing my forehead. &quot;You&#39;re worth waiting for.&quot;</p>
<p>The guilt of his patience, his genuine care, his belief that I was something worth cherishing rather than something built to his specifications-it sat heavy in my chest.</p>
<p>Rivera proposed three weeks later at the same restaurant where we&#39;d had our first date. Got down on one knee in front of other diners who applauded when I said yes. Slipped a ring on my finger, the diamond catching the candlelight and throwing tiny rainbows across the white tablecloth.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve made me so happy,&quot; he said, and the genuine emotion in his voice made me cry for reasons I couldn&#39;t fully articulate. To the world, I was crying tears of joy.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The walk down the aisle took both forever and no time at all.</p>
<p>Two hundred faces blurred into a collective witness-people who mattered, people who&#39;d discuss this moment over drinks for months, people who saw a beautiful bride and a successful governor and thought they were watching a love story.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>My heels clicked against the floor with each step. The ivory silk rustled around my legs. The weight of my breasts shifted against the corset bodice with each breath. Every physical sensation a reminder of the two years of systematic transformation that had led to this moment.</p>
<p>Rivera watched me approach with what looked like genuine happiness. We&#39;d both chosen this arrangement, both understood the transaction. But the feelings that had developed during our courtship hadn&#39;t been in the contract.</p>
<p>Casey stood near the front-witness to her own creation, watching me walk down the aisle just as she&#39;d planned. Our eyes met briefly and something passed between us. History. Understanding. Acknowledgment that we both knew exactly what this was and exactly what it had cost.</p>
<p>I reached the altar. Rivera took my hand, squeezed gently, smiled with affection I couldn&#39;t quite parse.</p>
<p>The officiant began. Words about love and commitment and partnership that would have been beautiful if they weren&#39;t describing a carefully negotiated arrangement. Rivera&#39;s responses were firm, certain.</p>
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; I said when prompted, and the words felt both like truth and performance.</p>
<p>Rivera&#39;s kiss was gentle, genuine, sweet in ways that made this complicated. Two hundred people saw a perfect bride being kissed by her groom. None of them knew what remained hidden beneath the wedding dress, the male anatomy that made this partnership possible.</p>
<p>The photographer captured it all-the moment Evita Morgan became Evita Morgan-Rivera, the erasure complete.</p>
<p>Applause washed over us. Two hundred people celebrating a union they thought they understood. We walked back down the aisle together, his hand on my lower back, both of us smiling for the cameras.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The Ritz-Carlton Presidential Suite had floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city, a California king bed with sheets that felt like liquid, champagne chilling in a bucket neither of us had asked for.</p>
<p>Michael-he was Michael to me now, not Rivera, not the Governor, just my husband-loosened his tie, looking suddenly nervous in ways he hadn&#39;t during the ceremony. &quot;I know this is... complicated. The arrangement. But I want you to know I care about you. Really care. This isn&#39;t just-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know.&quot; I cut him off because hearing him try to justify the transaction made it worse. &quot;I care about you too.&quot;</p>
<p>True enough. We&#39;d created something genuine even if it had started as choreography. He was kind and smart and actually listened when I talked. He deserved better than what he was getting.</p>
<p>He crossed the room, cupped my face in his hands. &quot;Tell me if anything doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;</p>
<p>I never would. I&#39;d always say yes. That was part of the arrangement. But he asked every time anyway, trying to make the transaction feel like choice.</p>
<p>His kiss was more urgent than at the altar. Hands untying the corset laces of my dress, sliding it down with care. The ivory silk pooled at my feet and I stepped out of it in the white lingerie the stylist had selected-lace and satin designed to be removed.</p>
<p>When that came off too, Michael&#39;s hands found what remained beneath all the surgical feminization. Male anatomy that the hormones had changed but not eliminated, exactly what he needed even if he was decent enough to be uncomfortable about needing it.</p>
<p>He guided me to the bed, his hands gentle on my surgically enhanced breasts, mouth following where his fingers had traced. The sensitivity there still caught me off-guard-nerve endings rewired by hormones and surgical intervention.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t hard yet. That was normal now-the estrogen had changed everything about arousal. What used to happen automatically now required patience, the right kind of stimulation.</p>
<p>Michael hesitated, uncertain. His hand wrapped around me tentatively, trying to find the right pressure, the right rhythm.</p>
<p>&quot;Like this?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A little slower. More... gentle.&quot;</p>
<p>He adjusted, and I felt myself respond gradually-not with the immediate urgency I&#39;d once known, but with the slower build the hormones had created.</p>
<p>My mind started working on multiple tracks. Part of me cataloging sensations clinically-pressure, warmth, the slide of his hand. Part of me noting his technique, his care, filing away information about what worked. Part of me thinking about the political implications of this moment, how tomorrow we&#39;d wake up as a married couple and everything would change.</p>
<p>Part of me wondering if Casey was somewhere in the hotel, satisfied that everything was going according to plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me what feels good,&quot; he murmured against my hip.</p>
<p>&quot;That. Keep doing that.&quot;</p>
<p>His tongue replaced his hand and I gasped despite myself. The hormones had made everything more sensitive in strange ways-less urgent but more intense, pleasure that built in layers instead of a straight line toward release. My body responded even while my mind stayed partially detached, watching this happen from a distance.</p>
<p>I heard myself making sounds, small gasps and sighs-responsive but not too loud, appreciative but controlled. Even now, even here, I was performing. The realization should have been horrifying but instead felt inevitable. Everything was performance. This was just another role.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t attracted to men, I kept telling myself. But my body didn&#39;t care about orientation-it responded to skilled touch, to years of hormones that had separated desire from physical pleasure.</p>
<p>It felt good. That was the part I couldn&#39;t reconcile. Michael was patient, attentive, genuinely trying to figure out what worked despite the newness of it. His mouth moved with increasing confidence while his hands stroked my thighs, and I felt the orgasm building despite everything-despite not wanting this, despite the transaction, despite knowing this would be my life now.</p>
<p>When I came, it was different than it used to be. Fuller, deeper, rolling through my whole body instead of concentrated in one place. The hormones had changed even this, made climax feel more complete and somehow more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Michael moved up to kiss me, his own arousal evident against my hip. &quot;Was that okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Not a lie. My body was still humming with aftershocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I...?&quot; He gestured vaguely downward.</p>
<p>I nodded, and he retrieved lubricant from the nightstand.</p>
<p>He was gentle. Careful. Worked me open with his fingers first, clearly uncertain about what he was doing but trying to make sure it didn&#39;t hurt, that I was ready. The physical sensation was strange but not unpleasant.</p>
<p>When he finally entered me, I whimpered through the initial discomfort. He stilled immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Should I stop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Just... give me a second.&quot;</p>
<p>He waited, perfectly still inside me, until my body adjusted. Then he moved slowly, carefully, watching for any sign of pain. I bit my lip, determined not to show him any.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t hurt as much after the first minute. My mind was detached, compiling information like watching from above: this is what sex with a man feels like, this is what being penetrated means, this is my life now. Clinical observations, collecting data, the absence of sexual attraction removing me from what was happening to my body.</p>
<p>But then my body finally relaxed, or he found the right angle-whatever it was, something shifted. The sensations stopped being strange information to file away and became immediate, undeniable. The fullness of being penetrated, the friction, my breasts moving with each thrust. When he hit certain spots the pleasure spiked sharp enough that thinking became impossible.</p>
<p>I moaned without meaning to. He touched me while he moved, keeping me engaged, and I stopped cataloging anything. Just felt it-his care, my body&#39;s response, the building intensity that had nothing to do with wanting him and everything to do with nerve endings that didn&#39;t care about sexual orientation.</p>
<p>He brought me close to the edge again before he finished, then worked me through completion with his hand after, his breathing ragged against my shoulder.</p>
<p>Afterward, lying beside someone who loved a woman who didn&#39;t entirely exist, I stared at the ceiling and listened to his breathing even out into sleep.</p>
<p>His arm draped across my waist, possessive but gentle. Tomorrow we&#39;d fly to Tuscany for our honeymoon. Two weeks of performing newlywed bliss for photographers who&#39;d document our every movement. Then back to reality-his governorship, my role as political wife, Casey&#39;s control over both of us.</p>
<p>Michael murmured something in his sleep, pulled me closer. His wife. His partner. First Lady Evita Morgan-Rivera. Casey&#39;s greatest creation.</p>
