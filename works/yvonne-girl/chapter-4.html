          The hardest conversation came the night before the procedure. Yvonne sat across from Beau Richardson in their favorite Italian restaurant, watching candlelight play across his concerned features. They'd been dating for six months—long enough to be serious, not quite long enough to have navigated a crisis of this magnitude.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Let me make sure I understand this correctly," Beau said, his voice carefully neutral in the way that meant he was processing something enormous. "You're going to undergo a complete biological transformation to become the face of a political campaign. And you're telling me this now, the night before it happens?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne knew how it sounded. She'd spent her entire legal career arguing cases where timing and disclosure mattered, where the sequence of information could make or break a verdict. This was a textbook case of poor communication strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The NDA restrictions were severe," she explained, knowing it wasn't enough of an excuse. "But you're right. I should have found a way to talk to you sooner. This is going to change everything."
        </p>

          <a href="../../images/works/yvonne-girl-placeholder.jpg">
            <div class="hero__image-wrapper" style="max-width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;">

          </a>
          <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">The moment everything changed between them</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Beau set down his wine glass, and Yvonne recognized the lawyer in him shifting into analytical mode. "Will you still be you? After the transformation, I mean. Will you still think the same way, feel the same way?"
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the question she'd been asking herself since the moment David first proposed this plan. "Cognitively, yes. The procedure doesn't affect neural pathways or memory. But physically, emotionally... I honestly don't know. How much of who we are is tied to how we move through the world? How much changes when society sees us completely differently?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The look on Beau's face told her everything she needed to know. This relationship, like so much else in her life, was about to become another casualty of electoral mathematics. Some transformations went far deeper than biology.
