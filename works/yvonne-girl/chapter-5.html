          Waking up in the recovery suite was like surfacing from the deepest sleep of her life. Yvonne's first conscious thought was that everything felt different—lighter, somehow, as if gravity itself had been recalibrated. Her second thought was that the sensations flooding her nervous system were so unfamiliar that she couldn't quite process them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Winters appeared in her field of vision, checking monitors with practiced efficiency. "Take it slowly," the doctor advised. "Your proprioception—your sense of your body in space—needs time to adjust. Your brain is receiving sensory input from entirely new physical coordinates."
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne tried to sit up and discovered that the simple act of moving required recalibrating every assumption she'd ever made about leverage and balance. Her center of gravity had shifted. Her muscle mass distributed differently. Even her vision seemed subtly changed, viewing the world from a perspective a few inches lower than she was accustomed to.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          "Are you ready to see?" Dr. Winters asked, and Yvonne realized she'd been avoiding looking at the mirror positioned strategically across from the recovery bed.
        </p>

        <p>
          She nodded, and the doctor adjusted the bed so Yvonne could see her reflection. The woman looking back at her was a stranger—professionally attractive in the way that campaign consultants and image makers considered optimal. Mid-thirties, conventionally beautiful but not threateningly so, with the kind of polished appearance that polling data suggested voters found trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it wasn't her. The face in the mirror belonged to someone created by electoral mathematics and focus group feedback. And now Yvonne had to learn how to inhabit it, how to make this manufactured identity feel authentic enough to convince millions of voters that she was real.
        </p>

        <p>
          The irony wasn't lost on her. In trying to solve the campaign's authenticity problem, she'd become the most inauthentic thing imaginable—a person literally constructed to meet market demands.
