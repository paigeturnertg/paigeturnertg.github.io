        <p class="drop-cap">The walk to Beau&#39;s office felt like a death march in heels. Casey walked beside me, maintaining professional distance, but I caught her efficiently adjusting her skirt as if she were heading to just another regular meeting instead of our impending professional doom.</p>
<p>We&#39;d been sloppy. Desperate. Fucking stupid.</p>
<p>My fault, really. I&#39;d let the Jenkins disaster spiral me, and then sought comfort in the worst possible place-my deputy&#39;s arms. In the middle of the work day. Right there on my desk like some clich&eacute; from a political thriller. Though given how this whole Yvonne performance had been deteriorating my judgment, maybe it was inevitable. Like everything else in my transformation, what started as strategy had become something messier. Something that felt dangerously real.</p>
<p>Beau&#39;s door stood open. He was behind his desk, back to us, staring out at the Capitol grounds where spring was finally winning its battle against winter. When we entered, he didn&#39;t turn around.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit,&quot; he said. &quot;Not next to each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey took the chair by the window. I chose the one nearest the door, an old habit. Always know your exit, my father used to say. Though in this case, there might not be one.</p>
<p>The silence stretched until my skin crawled. Outside, a tour group posed for photos on the Capitol steps, their distant laughter a mockery of our situation. The grandfather clock in the corner-another Fenstemaker heirloom-ticked with metronomic judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, Beau turned. His face wore that particular expression of controlled fury I&#39;d seen him deploy against legislators who&#39;d betrayed him. But underneath was something else. Disappointment, maybe. Or disgust.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn who you&#39;re fucking,&quot; he began, each word precise as a scalpel. &quot;But I do care about this administration&#39;s credibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#39;s review your recent performance, shall we?&quot; He didn&#39;t need notes-every failure was catalogued in his memory like evidence for prosecution. &quot;This morning, the Jenkins memo. You sent our internal strategy directly to him. Nearly cost us the unity endorsement.&quot;</p>
<p>My face burned under the makeup, the hunger-induced brain fog that had caused that catastrophic error still fresh in my mind. Three months of Casey&#39;s starvation diet had sharpened my cheekbones but apparently dulled my political instincts.</p>
<p>&quot;The education budget,&quot; he continued. &quot;Two million dollar error that Casey caught. The Riverside fundraiser where you forgot Harold Nesmith&#39;s wife&#39;s name-a woman who&#39;s donated half a million to our campaigns.&quot;</p>
<p>Each failure cut clean through me. The truth was, I&#39;d been so focused on surviving in heels and padded bras that I&#39;d stopped paying attention to the job that had defined me. The irony was bitter: what started as a gambit to prove my competence to Beau had made me genuinely incompetent at everything that actually mattered.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve been so focused on your...&quot; he gestured vaguely at my appearance, &quot;transformation, that you&#39;ve forgotten how to do your actual job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; he cut me off, &quot;Casey&#39;s holding this entire administration together while you&#39;ve been playing dress-up. Those transparency forums? Her idea. The youth voter initiative? Her execution. Without her damage control on your mistakes, we&#39;d have imploded months ago.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched Casey accept the praise with professional modesty, though I caught a flash of satisfaction in her eyes before she composed herself. She deserved the recognition. While I&#39;d been learning to walk in heels, she&#39;d been doing my job and hers, keeping both our careers intact through her superhuman competence.</p>
<p>&quot;But today&#39;s little display?&quot; Beau&#39;s voice dropped to arctic temperatures. &quot;That&#39;s the end. You can&#39;t date your direct report. I can&#39;t begin to count all the nepotism laws and HR rules that violates, and Lockwood&#39;s campaign would destroy us with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Governor-&quot; Casey started, leaning forward with genuine concern.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not finished.&quot; He pulled out a folder. &quot;Resignation letters. Already drafted for your signatures.&quot;</p>
<p>My stomach dropped through the floor. After everything-the dress, the diet, the humiliation of becoming Yvonne-it would end with a &quot;resignation&quot; that actually meant being fired for inappropriate conduct. My father would be thrilled. His failure of a son, now his failure of a daughter, finally achieving the complete disgrace he&#39;d predicted.</p>
<p>&quot;However,&quot; Beau said, and that single word held more danger than any threat, &quot;I have an alternative proposition.&quot;</p>
<p>He theatrically set the folder aside. &quot;Yvonne, you&#39;re our new Press Secretary.&quot;</p>
<p>The words didn&#39;t compute. &quot;I&#39;m... what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Press Secretary. After all, you created the vacancy when you fired Tommy.&quot; His smile had too many teeth. &quot;It&#39;s actually perfect. You know our policies backward and forward, you present well, and most importantly-you&#39;ll report directly to me. No more conflict of interest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#39;s a demotion,&quot; I said, the words escaping before wisdom could stop them.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s better than termination. And it will let you focus on your outward presentation in a way that actually helps the campaign.&quot; He turned to Casey. &quot;You&#39;ll be Acting Chief of Staff. You&#39;re already doing the job anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s intake of breath was almost inaudible. But I heard it. Acting Chief of Staff at thirty-two. Everything she&#39;d worked for, handed to her because I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off her.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re punishing me,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m finding a solution,&quot; Beau corrected. &quot;Unless you&#39;d prefer option one?&quot;</p>
<p>The resignation letters sat between us like a loaded gun. I thought about the media circus that would follow. &quot;Former Chief of Staff Fired for Inappropriate Relationship During Gender Transition.&quot; My father wouldn&#39;t just be disappointed-he&#39;d be vindicated. Every doubt he&#39;d expressed about my emotional stability, my fitness for politics, confirmed in headlines.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; I said, the word ash in my mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent. You start tomorrow. Casey, get Yvonne up to speed on the press schedule.&quot; He was already turning back to his window, dismissing us like servants who&#39;d outlived their usefulness. &quot;Consider yourselves lucky I&#39;m not firing you both. The campaign needs stability, not more drama.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey stood first, professional mask perfect. I followed, my legs unsteady for reasons that had nothing to do with the two-inch heels I wore.</p>
<p>The walk back from Beau&#39;s office felt longer than the walk there. Casey said nothing until we were behind closed doors in my former office. Her new domain.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, though she was subconsciously already taking ownership of the space. She straightened papers on the desk, adjusted the computer monitor-small territorial adjustments that marked the changing of guard. &quot;I didn&#39;t want it like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you?&quot; I sank into the chair across from what used to be my desk. &quot;You&#39;re Acting Chief of Staff now. Everything you worked for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not like this, Evan.&quot; She moved around the desk, her hand settling on my shoulder with familiar warmth. &quot;I wanted to earn it, not have it handed to me because you got caught in an impossible situation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Press Secretary,&quot; I said, testing the title. &quot;My father&#39;s going to love this. His son demoted to the pretty face behind the podium, delivering other people&#39;s messages like some political ventriloquist&#39;s dummy.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey moved around the desk, her hand settling on my shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s temporary. Let Beau cool off a bit and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll reinstate you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should prepare for tomorrow,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll email you the press schedule.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like that, I was dismissed from my own office.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The first week as Press Secretary was an exercise in professional competence wrapped in personal humiliation.</p>
<p>Every morning I stood behind the podium in the briefing room, wearing heels and pants that zipped up the side, the padded bra creating modest curves under professional blazers that Casey helped me select. The reporters were respectful enough-I knew the administration inside and out, could quote statistics and legislative history, and spoke about our policies with the fluency that came from years of crafting them.</p>

<p>But no matter what I said, the policies I announced were never the story. They were always a sidebar to my personal life. The transgender Chief of Staff turned Press Secretary, bravely continuing her transition while serving the state. Every question about policy came with undertones about my personal journey. Every off-the-record conversation ended with someone asking about my &quot;inspiration&quot; or my &quot;courage,&quot; as if my greatest political achievement was wearing panties while explaining tax policy.</p>
<p>The real insult was how good I was at it. Seven years of crisis management had taught me to stay calm under pressure, to deflect hostile questions, to make boring policy sound compelling. I could handle a room full of reporters trying to trip me up, could pivot from budget discussions to legislative updates without missing a beat. But instead of being recognized for political competence, I was praised for &quot;authentic representation&quot; and &quot;visibility in government.&quot;</p>
<p>Democratic theater at its finest. The press secretary as performance art instead of political professional.</p>
<p>Within a few days, I&#39;d settled into the rhythm of diminished expectations. Morning briefings, afternoon background calls, evening preparation for the next day&#39;s message discipline. It was like being a highly educated parrot, repeating brilliantly crafted talking points that other people-Casey, mainly-had written.</p>
<p>But the briefings themselves weren&#39;t the only humiliation. It was the small moments between them that revealed how completely my world had shifted.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Thursday afternoon, Derek appeared in my cramped office doorway without knocking-a courtesy he&#39;d never forgotten when this was a supply closet and I was his boss.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick favor,&quot; he said, leaning in a little closer than he should. &quot;I&#39;m heading into the strategy meeting. Can you run copies of the education press release? We need twenty.&quot;</p>
<p>I stared at him. &quot;I&#39;m the press secretary, not your secretary. Get a staffer to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, no offense. I just asked because you were right here. I didn&#39;t mean anything by it.&quot; His tone was reasonable, apologetic. &quot;Forget I asked.&quot;</p>
<p>But the message was clear. In Derek&#39;s mind, I was now the kind of person who could be asked to make copies.</p>
<p>The strategy meeting itself was worse. I sat at the conference table-my former conference table-while Derek led discussion of messaging frameworks I&#39;d developed over months of polling research. When I tried to explain the nuances of suburban voter sentiment, Kevin interrupted me mid-sentence to ask Derek about budget timeline.</p>
<p>&quot;As I was saying,&quot; I continued, but Derek had moved on to discussing media placement strategies with Janet.</p>
<p>&quot;The suburban women demographic shows specific resistance to confrontational language,&quot; I tried again.</p>
<p>&quot;Right, right,&quot; Derek nodded absently, still looking at Janet. &quot;What&#39;s the timeline on the television buys?&quot;</p>
<p>For twenty minutes, I watched my expertise get systematically ignored. When I referenced focus group findings, Kevin talked over me to suggest we &quot;do some research on voter sentiment.&quot; When I offered messaging frames based on months of data analysis, Derek would pause politely, then immediately ask someone else what they thought about &quot;approaches to messaging.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The education polling shows clear preference for investment language over spending language,&quot; I said during a brief lull.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Derek agreed. &quot;Kevin, what do you think about emphasizing investment themes?&quot;</p>
<p>Kevin brightened. &quot;Great idea. Investment definitely tests better than spending with our target demographics.&quot;</p>
<p>He&#39;d just repeated my exact words back to Derek as his own insight.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Derek lingered as others filed out.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for the input today,&quot; he said. &quot;Really appreciate having your perspective.&quot;</p>
<p>The condescension was so polite I almost missed it. Perspective. Not expertise, not leadership. Perspective.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>The next day, Karen Welles paid me a visit, closing the door behind her with conspiratorial care.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey girl,&quot; she announced, settling into my single visitor chair. &quot;Ugh, how insufferable was Kevin in yesterday&#39;s coordination meeting? The mansplaining was off the charts.&quot;</p>
<p>Karen ran the scheduling office and had been navigating these political waters for over a decade. She knew exactly where every body was buried, which made her casual tone even more calculated. When I was Chief of Staff, she&#39;d brought me calendar conflicts and logistics briefings with professional efficiency. Never gossip about male colleagues.</p>
<p>&quot;Kevin&#39;s always been condescending,&quot; I said carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#39;s different now, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Karen&#39;s smile was knowing, sympathetic. &quot;Now that we&#39;re on the same level, we can actually talk about these things.&quot;</p>
<p>The same level. She leaned forward, voice dropping to an intimate register I&#39;d never heard from her before.</p>
<p>&quot;I know exactly what it&#39;s like dealing with these men. The way they assume we can&#39;t handle complex scheduling, the little comments about being &#39;organized&#39; when they mean obsessive.&quot;</p>
<p>She was including me in some shared sisterhood that had apparently existed in her mind for months, but only now felt safe to express.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m still the press secretary. I still have expertise-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you do, sweetie. But you don&#39;t need to worry about all that boring policy stuff anymore. Casey&#39;s handling the real strategic work.&quot; Karen reached across the desk to pat my hand with maternal condescension. &quot;You can focus on what you&#39;re naturally good at now. The communication, the presentation, the softer skills.&quot;</p>
<p>Softer skills. The phrase was a knife wrapped in silk.</p>
<p>&quot;Karen, I wrote most of the policy frameworks this administration runs on. I&#39;ve been doing this longer than-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know, I know.&quot; She waved dismissively. &quot;But that was before. This is about finding your authentic self, right? Embracing who you really are instead of trying to be something you&#39;re not?&quot;</p>
<p>The irony was staggering. Here was Karen, offering sisterly support while systematically undermining everything I&#39;d accomplished in my career. She thought she was being kind, helping me adjust to my &quot;natural&quot; role as a woman in their professional ecosystem.</p>
<p>But what stung most was the timeline. Karen&#39;s willingness to confide in me, to treat me as a peer rather than a superior, hadn&#39;t emerged from my gender presentation. It had emerged from my demotion. For three months, she&#39;d worked with Yvonne the Chief of Staff with perfect professionalism. Only when I lost institutional power did she decide we were sisters in struggle.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually,&quot; she continued, brightening with inspiration, &quot;you should help me coordinate the office holiday party this year. You&#39;d be perfect for that kind of event coordination. I mean, I usually handle it through myself, but honestly? It&#39;s so much work juggling venues and catering with everything else. Much more fun than budget spreadsheets, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Event coordination. From Chief of Staff to party planner in one helpful suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; I said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful!&quot; She gathered her things with satisfaction. &quot;Oh, and Yvonne? That lip color is gorgeous on you. You have to tell me where you got it.&quot;</p>
<p>After she left, I sat alone in my tiny office, understanding something that should have been obvious. The respectful treatment I&#39;d received for three months hadn&#39;t been acceptance-it had been professional necessity. Derek&#39;s dismissive confidence, Karen&#39;s sisterly condescension, Kevin&#39;s patronizing explanations-all of it had been there beneath the surface, waiting for the moment when my demotion made it safe to express.</p>
<p>The real work was happening in my former office, where Casey was implementing strategies I would have developed if I&#39;d still had access to internal polling and strategic planning. I&#39;d catch glimpses of her through the door, leading meetings I used to run, making decisions that used to require my input. She was thriving in the role, bringing her own vision to problems I&#39;d been wrestling with for months.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Wednesday afternoon, she knocked on the door of my new office.</p>
<p>&quot;Good news,&quot; she said, though her expression suggested complications I wasn&#39;t going to like. &quot;Authentic Voices wants an exclusive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The LGBTQ magazine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Major circulation, influential readership. Great chance to solidify community support for the campaign.&quot; She set the interview request on my desk, already marked with her notes and suggested talking points. The efficiency was impressive and somehow diminishing, as if I were unable to do my demoted responsibilities myself. &quot;Interview&#39;s tomorrow evening if you accept.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are they interested in a campaign story or making this about my personal journey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Both, but let&#39;s be honest-they&#39;re not calling because of your infrastructure expertise. They want the transition story with political seasoning. Of course, it&#39;s up to you,&quot; she added, which was her way of saying it wasn&#39;t. &quot;But refusing would raise questions about your commitment to the community you&#39;re supposedly representing.&quot;</p>
<p>Supposedly. The word hung between us, acknowledgment of the performance we were both maintaining.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll set it up.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey smiled. &quot;Jazmine Porter is the author. She&#39;s good people-trans woman, been covering politics for years. You&#39;ll like her.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Thursday evening arrived with spring rain that turned the Capitol grounds into an impressionist painting. Jazmine met me at a coffee shop downtown, one of those aggressively progressive places with pronouns on nametags and pride flags in every configuration.</p>
<p>She was everything I wasn&#39;t-confident in her skin, graceful in her movements, authentically feminine in ways no amount of coaching could teach me. Her dark hair was pulled back in a sleek high ponytail, her makeup subtle but flawless, her voice pitched in a register that didn&#39;t sound forced. When she smiled at me as I sat down, it reached her eyes with genuine warmth.</p>
<p>&quot;Yvonne! I&#39;m so excited to finally meet you.&quot; Her handshake was warm, firm. &quot;You&#39;ve been such an inspiration to our community.&quot;</p>
<p>Our community. As if I belonged there instead of being a tourist in their struggle.</p>
<p>The interview itself went smoothly enough. Policy questions I could handle in my sleep. Campaign strategy that Casey had drilled into me. The importance of representation in government, words I&#39;d memorized from advocacy group talking points. Jazmine took notes with elegant fingers, occasionally tapping her pen against her lips with a gesture so naturally feminine it made my attempts look like parody.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re doing amazing work,&quot; she said as we wrapped up and we went off the record. &quot;Having someone like you in such a visible position-it matters. It really does.&quot;</p>
<p>The guilt sat in my stomach like spoiled food. Here was someone genuinely invested in trans visibility, praising me for representation I was performing rather than embodying. Every word of encouragement felt like another layer of deception.</p>
<p>She was packing up her recorder when she asked it, casual as weather talk: &quot;Who are you seeing for your HRT?&quot;</p>
<p>I stared at her, the words not quite processing. &quot;My what?&quot;</p>
<p>Her expression shifted from casual to concerned in an instant. &quot;Your hormone replacement therapy. Wait-you are on hormones, right?&quot;</p>
<p>The coffee shop suddenly felt smaller, the ambient noise fading to a buzz as I realized the trap I&#39;d walked into. &quot;I... it&#39;s complicated...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh god.&quot; Her hand covered her mouth, eyes widening with sisterly alarm. &quot;You&#39;re DIY-ing, aren&#39;t you? Ordering online?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, I get it.&quot; She reached across the table, grabbed my hand with the earnest intensity of someone who&#39;d been there herself. &quot;Finding a good doctor is hard. The waitlists, the gatekeeping, the insurance battles. But self-medicating is dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not self-medicating.&quot; Which was true, technically. I wasn&#39;t medicating at all. Because I wasn&#39;t actually transitioning. Which I couldn&#39;t possibly tell her.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been out? Six months?&quot; She was already pulling out her phone. &quot;And no medical support? Absolutely not. We&#39;re fixing this right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jazmine, really, it&#39;s fine-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not fine. Do you know what unsupervised hormone therapy can do? Blood clots, liver damage, mood swings that can trigger serious depression?&quot; She was already dialing. &quot;Dr. Martinez? It&#39;s Jazmine. I have an emergency.&quot;</p>
<p>My phone buzzed. Casey: &quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>
<p>I typed back: &quot;Being kidnapped by kindness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She can see us now,&quot; Jazmine announced, standing. &quot;Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t just leave-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve been publicly transitioning for months without proper medical supervision? As a government official? What kind of example does that set?&quot; She was already heading for the door. &quot;My car&#39;s outside.&quot;</p>
<p>I followed because refusing would mean explaining why I didn&#39;t need hormones. Explaining that this was all temporary. Explaining that Yvonne was a costume I&#39;d be shedding in November.</p>
<p>Jazmine&#39;s hybrid smelled like vanilla air freshener and newsprint. She drove while talking about her own transition, how finding Dr. Martinez had changed everything, how hormones had saved her life. Every word was another bar in the cage I&#39;d built around myself.</p>
<p>The clinic was tucked between a yoga studio and a vegan restaurant in the arts district, the kind of medical practice that specialized in serving marginalized communities with dignity instead of judgment. The waiting room had the aggressive cheerfulness of places trying to combat medical anxiety-bright colors, inspirational posters about authenticity and courage, a coffee table covered in magazines featuring happy LGBTQ people living their best lives.</p>
<p>Dr. Martinez had the bearing of someone who&#39;d earned every credential on her wall-Johns Hopkins medical degree, board certifications, and a small pride pin that suggested she&#39;d been fighting these battles longer than most. She took one look at me and made assumptions that were both completely wrong and impossible to correct.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been transitioning without medical support?&quot; she asked, voice gentle.</p>
<p>&quot;A few months,&quot; I lied, trying to avoid giving too much detail.</p>
<p>&quot;And Jazmine says you&#39;ve been taking DIY hormones? Which, now that I can see your complexion and the roundness in your face, is obvious.&quot;</p>
<p>It was too difficult to explain that I&#39;d just been using Casey&#39;s skin creams and doing yoga, so I half-lied again, hoping it would get me out of the conversation. &quot;I&#39;ll stop taking them?&quot;</p>
<p>Jazmine held my hand with sisterly support.. &quot;You&#39;re so brave doing this alone. But you don&#39;t have to anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Martinez was already preparing supplies. &quot;We&#39;ll start you on a standard dose. Estradiol injection weekly, spironolactone for testosterone blocking. We&#39;ll adjust based on your lab results and physical response.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Injections?&quot; My voice cracked like a teenager. I hated needles.</p>
<p>&quot;They work better than pills for most people. More stable hormone levels, better results over time.&quot; She was clinically drawing medication into a syringe. &quot;You&#39;ll need to come weekly at first for monitoring, then we can teach you to self-inject if you prefer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait.&quot; The word came out sharper than intended. Both women looked at me with concern, and I forced my voice back to appropriate registers. &quot;I need to think about this. Research the side effects, talk to my insurance-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Honey,&quot; Dr. Martinez said gently, &quot;you&#39;ve been DIY-ing for months already. We&#39;re just making it safer.&quot;</p>
<p>The assumption trapped me completely. Deny it, and I&#39;d have to explain why someone publicly transitioning wasn&#39;t on hormones. Accept it, and I was committed to weekly injections that would actually feminize my body.</p>
<p>I looked at both expectant faces and realized I had no choice that didn&#39;t destroy everything. All my options were bad, so I picked the one that delayed the worst consequences. I nodded to the doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;I was terrified my first time too,&quot; Jazmine said, squeezing my hand with the warmth of shared experience. &quot;It gets easier. And the changes-god, the changes are amazing. Softer skin, breast development, fat redistribution to hips and thighs that makes you feel like your body finally matches who you are...&quot;</p>
<p>The needle went in before I could form an objection that wouldn&#39;t destroy everything. A sharp sting, then pressure as the oily fluid entered muscle. My first dose of something that would fundamentally alter my body&#39;s basic chemistry.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfect,&quot; Dr. Martinez said, applying a bandage. &quot;Same time next week?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually,&quot; Jazmine brightened with the enthusiasm of someone who&#39;d found a new project, &quot;I come Thursdays at six for my own appointments. We could sync up! Injection buddies!&quot;</p>
<p>I recognized the trap being built. Weekly appointments meant witnesses to my &quot;progress.&quot; Missing them would raise questions.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s...&quot; I scrambled for an excuse that wouldn&#39;t come. &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;d just agreed to a surveillance system disguised as friendship.</p>
<p>&quot;Amazing! I&#39;ll pick you up next week. We can get dinner after, make it a whole thing.&quot; She was already putting it in her phone calendar. &quot;This is so exciting! You&#39;re going to love the changes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t get her too excited, Jazmine,&quot; Dr. Martinez cautioned. &quot;Remember, it takes a while for any effects to show.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, some good news in this disaster of an afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Martinez mentioned progesterone once your levels stabilize,&quot; Jazmine continued as we walked to her car. &quot;That&#39;s when the real magic happens. Breast rounding, hip growth, emotional depth you didn&#39;t know you were missing. But that won&#39;t be for several months.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded, numb, the injection site throbbing with each heartbeat. Somewhere in my bloodstream, estrogen was beginning its slow work of reshaping my body from the inside out. Changes that would be subtle at first but increasingly visible, increasingly permanent.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>Casey was waiting when I got home, wine already open and dinner in progress.</p>
<p>&quot;How did it go?&quot; she asked, then saw my face. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m on hormones,&quot; I said, collapsing onto my couch. &quot;Actual hormones. Estrogen. Testosterone blockers.&quot;</p>
<p>I explained while she poured wine, her expression cycling through surprise and concern before settling on supportive determination.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s just until November,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Initial low dose, minimal changes. They&#39;ll all go away when you stop getting the injections.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Minimal changes? Casey, these things cause breast growth. Permanent breast growth. Fat redistribution that changes your body shape. Skin changes, voice changes, emotional changes.&quot; The wine was helping, but not enough. &quot;My body is going to literally feminize whether I want it to or not!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slowly,&quot; she countered. &quot;And subtly at first. By November-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By November I&#39;ll have tits!&quot; The word came out harsh, angry. &quot;Real ones, not padding. How exactly do I explain that when I&#39;m trying to go back to being Evan?&quot;</p>
<p>She sat beside me, hand on my thigh. &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out. We always do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jazmine wants to be injection buddies,&quot; I said. &quot;Every Thursday. She&#39;ll notice if changes don&#39;t happen as expected, if I&#39;m not responding to treatment the way someone actually transitioning would.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll figure out a way to separate your appointments before it goes too far.&quot; Casey&#39;s hand moved higher on my thigh. &quot;You&#39;re overthinking this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m on female hormones, Casey. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to overthink that.&quot;</p>
<p>She kissed me then, slow and deep, tasting like wine and reassurance. When we broke apart, her eyes were dark with something I couldn&#39;t quite read.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re going to be fine,&quot; she said with the confidence that had carried us through every crisis. &quot;Trust me.&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to. God, I wanted to. But the injection site still throbbed, and I could already imagine the hormones seeping into my cells, beginning their inevitable task of remaking me while I waited for an election that suddenly felt very, very far away.</p>
