          The first press conference was scheduled for three weeks after the transformation, giving Yvonne enough time to master basic physical coordination but not enough time to second-guess the enormity of what she was about to attempt. The campaign had crafted a backstory that was technically true—she was a legal professional with deep knowledge of the issues—while carefully omitting the part about her recently becoming a different person.
        </p>

        <p>
          Standing backstage at the community center in suburban Virginia, Yvonne could hear the murmur of assembled reporters and local party activists. Her reflection in the dressing room mirror showed someone who looked camera-ready and confident. Inside, she felt like an imposter waiting to be exposed.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Remember," David coached, adjusting her lapel microphone, "you're not lying to them. You're Yvonne Matthews, campaign strategist. Everything you're about to say is true. The polling data, the policy positions, the legal analysis—that's all you. The packaging is just... presentation."
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          But Yvonne knew it was more complicated than that. Every time she spoke, she'd be performing a kind of truth that was simultaneously genuine and manufactured. Her expertise was real. Her passion for the issues was authentic. But the person delivering that message had been constructed by the same kind of strategic thinking that went into opposition research and attack ads.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stage manager gave her a signal. It was time. Yvonne took a deep breath, feeling the unfamiliar mechanics of her transformed physiology, and stepped into the lights. A hundred camera flashes erupted, capturing the debut of a candidate who was real and artificial in equal measure.
        </p>

        <p>
          She began speaking about healthcare policy, about economic inequality, about the issues that had driven her into political advocacy in the first place. And as the words flowed, she realized something unexpected: the substance mattered more than the packaging. The ideas were more powerful than the image. She just had to hope the voters could see past the constructed exterior to the authentic passion underneath.
