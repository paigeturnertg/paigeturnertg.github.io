          The polling data started shifting within two weeks of Yvonne's public debut. Focus groups that had previously dismissed the campaign as "out of touch" and "disconnected" were suddenly using words like "relatable" and "authentic." The numbers with female voters began climbing steadily, and social media analytics showed significantly improved engagement across key demographics.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's working," David said, spreading the latest survey results across the war room table. "We've cut the incumbent's lead in half. The message is penetrating in ways it never did before. You're connecting with voters who wouldn't have given us a second look a month ago."
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne studied the data with mixed feelings. Her legal expertise was the same as it had always been. Her understanding of policy hadn't changed. Her passion for the issues was genuine and long-standing. But apparently, all of that only mattered once it came packaged in a form that voters found palatable.
        </p>

        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

        <p>
          The real test came during a televised town hall in suburban Ohio. Yvonne fielded questions about healthcare, education funding, and economic opportunity with the same substance-driven answers she'd been giving for years. But this time, the audience was listening. This time, they weren't dismissed as talking points from an out-of-touch elite.
        </p>

        <p>
          A woman in the third row stood up during the Q&A, her voice shaking slightly. "You're the first candidate who's ever made me feel like someone in politics actually understands what my life is like," she said. "Everything you're saying about childcare and wage stagnation and healthcare costs—that's my life. And I've never felt like anyone running for office actually got it before."
        </p>

        <p>
          Yvonne felt the weight of that statement settle over her like a physical presence. This woman wasn't responding to manufactured imagery or strategic positioning. She was responding to substance, to ideas, to policy proposals that would actually improve her life. But she'd only started listening once Yvonne arrived in packaging she found trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the central paradox of her entire transformation: the ideas had always been authentic, but only the artifice made them accessible. She'd become more fake to seem more real. And somehow, impossibly, it was working.
