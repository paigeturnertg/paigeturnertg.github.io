      <article class="chapter__content">
        <p class="drop-cap">Elena woke at 2 AM, like clockwork. Six weeks old and already running the White House on her schedule.</p>
<p>I lifted her from the bassinet, feeling her familiar weight, her immediate rooting against my chest. My body responded before my drowsy brain fully engaged-milk letting down, the sharp pull of sensation I&#39;d learned meant survival, both hers and mine.</p>
<p>I settled into the nursing chair by the window, watching the floodlit monuments while she fed. This moment-quiet, necessary, chemical-was mine in ways that policy briefings and state dinners could never be.</p>
<p>A soft knock at the door. Casey, of course. Only Casey would be prowling the Residence at this hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Come in.&quot;</p>
<p>She entered carrying a tablet, pretending this was about tomorrow&#39;s childcare summit. But her eyes went immediately to the baby nursing in my arms.</p>
<p>I&#39;d seen that look before. In the hospital room, three hours after birth, when the nurse had placed her daughter on my chest for the first skin-to-skin contact. I&#39;d been focused on the baby, on the overwhelming flood of oxytocin and prolactin doing exactly what months of pharmaceutical preparation had designed me to do. But I&#39;d glanced up and caught Casey&#39;s expression before she could mask it.</p>
<p>Not clinical assessment. Not strategic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Naked longing.</p>
<p>Casey had been staring at her biological daughter bonding with someone else, and her face had shown everything she was trying to hide. Want. Grief. Love she hadn&#39;t anticipated feeling.</p>
<p>That&#39;s when I&#39;d understood. Casey&#39;s cage had two prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s eating well?&quot; Casey asked now, setting the tablet aside. The pretense of late-night policy discussions had worn thin over the past six weeks. We both knew why she visited at odd hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Every three hours.&quot; I adjusted the baby in my arms. &quot;Like clockwork.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey moved closer, watching Elena&#39;s small hand press against my breast, the rhythmic pull of feeding. Her expression showed the same hunger I&#39;d seen in the hospital-raw, unguarded, the kind of want that couldn&#39;t be strategized away.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I hold her? After?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;d been expecting this. Preparing for it, actually. Six weeks of watching Casey find excuses to visit. Six weeks of seeing her face when the baby cried and reached for me. Six weeks of dawning realization that this was what leverage looked like.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Elena finished suckling, her eyes already closing. I fastened my nursing bra-industrial-strength support for breasts that had grown enormous over the past months, permanent changes that would outlast any political cycle. I lifted her to my shoulder, rubbing her back until she burped, a small sound of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Then I stood and placed her in Casey&#39;s waiting arms.</p>
<p>Casey held her awkwardly at first, then with increasing confidence. Rocking gently. Making soft sounds. The baby settled, looking up at her with dark eyes.</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s eyes. I saw it now every time I looked for it. The shape of her face. The way she studied the world with focused intensity even at six weeks old.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey there,&quot; Casey whispered. &quot;Hey, beautiful girl.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched Casey fall deeper into whatever she&#39;d been denying for the past six weeks. Maternal instinct, biological imperative-whatever you wanted to call it, the woman who&#39;d orchestrated my complete destruction through pure calculation was undone by a six-week-old baby who didn&#39;t know strategy from hunger.</p>
<p>The baby started fussing. Small sounds at first, then building toward a cry. Hungry again already-growth spurt week, constant feeding, never enough.</p>
<p>Casey tried to soothe her, but the baby knew what she wanted. Turned toward me, crying now, rooting desperately against Casey&#39;s shirt where no milk would ever come.</p>
<p>&quot;She needs to nurse,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Casey handed her back, face carefully blank. But I&#39;d watched her long enough to see through the mask. The grief. The want. The understanding that this moment would repeat itself for years-Casey holding her daughter, Elena always reaching for someone else.</p>
<p>I settled back into the nursing chair, helped the baby latch. She fed greedily, one small hand pressed against my breast, completely trusting. Completely mine.</p>
<p>Casey stood by the window now, looking out at the monuments.</p>
<p>&quot;You love her,&quot; I said. Kept my voice level. Clinical. The way Casey would have delivered this information.</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s shoulders tensed. &quot;She&#39;s the dynasty. Of course I-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; I looked down at the baby, her dark hair, her tiny fingers. &quot;You love her. I watched you in the hospital. I see it every time you visit. You&#39;re not calculating anything. You want to be the one she reaches for.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I looked up, meeting Casey&#39;s reflection as she turned from the window. Her reflection had been easier to read than her face. Now she was all controlled tension, professional distance reasserting itself like armor.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want, Evie?&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted everything. My body back. My identity back. My life back. But we both knew that wasn&#39;t possible. Those were choices I&#39;d made-or had made for me-and the surgery and legal documents and political success had rendered them permanent.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to understand how this works now.&quot; I adjusted Elena in my arms, feeling her settle deeper into feeding. &quot;You get to see her when I allow it. Visit, watch her grow up, buy her expensive gifts. But you don&#39;t get to raise her. And I&#39;m not going to let her become like you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can.&quot; My voice stayed level. Facts, not threats. &quot;And you can&#39;t stop me without exposing everything. You&#39;d have to reveal that I&#39;m trans. That Michael married me knowing exactly what I am. That she was carried by a surrogate. That you&#39;re her biological mother. That this entire thing is fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey moved toward me, but stopped herself. &quot;You&#39;d go down too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would. But what happens to her?&quot; I looked down at the baby, still nursing peacefully, completely unaware of the manipulation that had created her existence. &quot;She grows up knowing her whole life was a lie. That her mother isn&#39;t her biological mother. That she was a chess piece. That her family is built on fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>I met Casey&#39;s eyes. &quot;Is that what you want for your daughter?&quot;</p>
<p>The silence stretched long enough that I could hear the baby&#39;s small sounds of feeding, the distant hum of the White House at night, my own heartbeat steady and certain.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll raise her well,&quot; I said. &quot;Brilliant like you, but with actual empathy. Competent without being cruel. I&#39;ll raise her for politics-not because you want me to, but because I think she could be extraordinary at it. Better than both of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#39;t keep me from her-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won&#39;t. You&#39;ll see her from afar. Holidays. Events.&quot; I paused, watching Casey process the terms. &quot;You&#39;ll watch her call me Mama and run to me when she&#39;s scared and tell me her secrets. And you&#39;ll know she&#39;s your daughter biologically, and you&#39;ll never be able to tell her.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s face showed the realization settling in. All her planning, all her manipulation, all her careful orchestration of my complete transformation-and she&#39;d trapped herself just as thoroughly.</p>
<p>&quot;You built the perfect trap,&quot; I said. &quot;Used hormones and systematic bonding to lock me in place. Made sure I&#39;d love her too completely to ever leave, made my body produce exactly what she needs to survive. You just didn&#39;t realize you were building a trap for yourself too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I wanted to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You won&#39;t.&quot; I said it with certainty. &quot;Because you&#39;re not willing to destroy her. Despite everything you&#39;ve done to me-destroying my career, my identity, my entire life-you won&#39;t cross that line. I know you, Casey. That&#39;s the one thing you won&#39;t do.&quot;</p>
<p>The baby finished nursing, falling asleep against my chest with the boneless trust of infants. I adjusted my shirt, settling her into the crook of my arm where she fit like she&#39;d been designed for it. Which, in a sense, she had been.</p>
<p>Casey stood trapped between what she wanted and what she was willing to sacrifice to get it. All her power, all her strategic brilliance, all her control over administrations and presidencies and political dynasties-none of it gave her access to this.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the cage, Casey.&quot; I kept my voice quiet so I wouldn&#39;t wake the baby. &quot;It&#39;s nicer than mine. You still have your power, your freedom, your identity. You just don&#39;t have her. Not the way you want. Not the way I do.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey walked to the door. Her hand on the handle, she paused. Looked back at us-me holding her daughter, the baby sleeping peacefully against my chest.</p>
<p>The grief on her face was real. Unguarded for just a moment before professionalism reasserted itself.</p>
<p>Then she left, closing the door with careful silence.</p>
<p>I sat alone with the baby sleeping in my arms, feeling the weight of what had just shifted between us.</p>
<p>She&#39;d planned everything so carefully. Made me into the perfect political wife, modified my body to carry and nurse her child, ensured I&#39;d bond too completely to ever leave. Given herself the political dynasty, the influence, the presidency.</p>
<p>She just hadn&#39;t planned on bonding herself. On wanting to be the one Elena reached for. On feeling genuine maternal love for a daughter she&#39;d given away before birth.</p>
<p>I looked down at the tiny face against my chest. She was beautiful. Perfect. Completely innocent of the manipulation and fraud that had created her.</p>
<p>And she was mine in every way that mattered to a six-week-old baby, I was her mother. I was the voice she knew, the smell she recognized, the body that fed her. I was safety and warmth and survival.</p>
<p>Casey had won everything she&#39;d fought for. The political dynasty. The influence. She&#39;d just lost the one thing she hadn&#39;t realized she wanted until it was too late.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, feeling the baby&#39;s weight against my chest, the ache in my shoulders from holding her, the pull in my breasts that meant she&#39;d be hungry again in a few hours.</p>
<p>This was my life now. This was all I had.</p>
<p>It would have to be enough.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The state dinner was everything diplomatic theater required-crystal chandeliers, elaborate floral arrangements, a string quartet playing something appropriately dignified. I&#39;d learned to navigate these events over the past year, smiling through six courses while wearing shoes designed to be looked at rather than walked in.</p>
<p>My champagne silk gown had been selected by a stylist-a woman whose job was making sure the First Lady photographed well from every angle. It worked. Floor-length with an asymmetric one-shoulder design, the structured bodice caught light like liquid gold. The elegant draping across my torso was both diplomatic enough for protocol and practical enough that I could slip the shoulder down when Elena needed to nurse. A subtle train required conscious awareness of my movements-everything calculated to signal both grace and authority.</p>
<p>I was standing with the French ambassador&#39;s wife, discussing early childhood education initiatives, when I saw him.</p>
<p>James Cross, silver-haired and still commanding a room at seventy-three, working his way through the crowd with the confidence of someone who&#39;d built a career on knowing exactly who mattered. He&#39;d been invited for his legendary status-the operative who&#39;d shaped three gubernatorial campaigns and advised two presidents. A living monument to political strategy.</p>
<p>My father.</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t recognize me. Why would he? Evan Cross had been declared dead two years ago-car accident, closed casket, small funeral that James hadn&#39;t attended because we&#39;d been estranged. The woman standing here in silk and three-inch heels, performing flawless diplomatic small talk? She was nobody James had ever met.</p>
<p>I watched him move closer, chatting with a senator&#39;s husband, laughing at something Secretary Coleman said. He was thinner than I remembered. Still sharp, still working the room, but there was something absent in his movements-the particular grief of a father who&#39;d buried his only child.</p>
<p>I should have walked away. Found an excuse to circulate to another part of the room. But some self-destructive impulse kept me rooted while he approached our small cluster.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Rivera,&quot; Secretary Coleman said, gently touching my elbow. &quot;Have you met James Cross? Legendary political strategist. James, this is our remarkable First Lady.&quot;</p>
<p>My father turned to me, warmly extending his hand. &quot;Mrs. Rivera. A pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>I shook his hand. Felt the familiar grip, the calloused palm from decades of shaking hands at rallies and fundraisers. Looked into eyes that had watched me grow up, that had judged every choice I&#39;d made, that had cut me out of his life when I&#39;d failed to measure up.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Cross,&quot; I managed. &quot;I&#39;ve heard so much about your work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#39;ve been impressed with yours.&quot; His smile was genuine. &quot;The literacy initiative you launched last month-brilliant. Early childhood intervention, bipartisan appeal, measurable outcomes. Exactly the kind of policy work that actually changes lives instead of just polling well.&quot;</p>
<p>I stifled a cynical laugh. Those were the exact principles he&#39;d taught Evan. The framework I&#39;d built my entire political approach around. But he never could find himself to praise me for it as his own progeny.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said. &quot;I believe effective policy requires both vision and practical execution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly right.&quot; James leaned in slightly, the way he used to when he was about to share strategic wisdom at those long-ago dinner tables. &quot;That&#39;s the kind of thinking this town needs more of. Substance over spectacle.&quot;</p>
<p>My throat closed. He&#39;d used those exact words a hundred times when I was growing up. His mantra. The standard he&#39;d held up that Evan had never quite reached.</p>
<p>&quot;The president and I work well together,&quot; I managed.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly.&quot; James glanced across the room to where Michael was discussing infrastructure with the German chancellor. &quot;President Rivera&#39;s made some remarkably astute policy decisions since taking office. Strong team around him.&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to tell him. Wanted to say: It&#39;s me, Dad. It&#39;s Evan. I&#39;m still here, still doing the work you taught me. That&#39;s whose efforts you&#39;re praising right now.</p>
<p>Instead I said: &quot;The president values collaborative decision-making.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As he should.&quot; James paused, watching me adjust my bracelet-a nervous habit I hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;d kept. His expression shifted.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s odd. You just-&quot; He shook his head slightly. &quot;My late wife used to do that exact thing. Same gesture when she was thinking through something complicated.&quot;</p>
<p>I froze, hand still on my wrist. Some habits ran deeper than surgery could reach.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry for your loss,&quot; I managed.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a long time ago.&quot; James&#39;s smile turned rueful. &quot;Though I seem to be in a reflective mood tonight. Lost my son a few years back too. Car accident.&quot; He glanced toward Michael across the room. &quot;Actually worked on your husband&#39;s first campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>My throat closed completely.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;d been estranged when he died,&quot; James continued, and I heard something I&#39;d never heard from him before-regret. &quot;He was troubled, searching for who he really was. I was too hard on him. Expected him to be something he couldn&#39;t be, or maybe something he was but I couldn&#39;t see it.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked directly at me. &quot;You remind me a bit of what he might have become, if I&#39;d been a better father.&quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t speak. Couldn&#39;t breathe. My father was standing here telling me he&#39;d been wrong about Evan, about Yvonne. That he saw value in work that was fundamentally mine. But he could only admit that now, only after believing I was dead, only when talking to a stranger.</p>
<p>Before my brain could craft a suitable response, a staffer appeared at my elbow, arriving to remind me of Elena&#39;s feeding schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Rivera, your daughter-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; I turned back to my father. &quot;It was truly a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Cross.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The pleasure was mine, Mrs. Rivera.&quot; He extended his hand again, and I shook it one last time. &quot;I hope we can continue this conversation sometime.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched him move away, rejoining the flow of power and influence, still the legendary James Cross to the end.</p>
<p>I excused myself and found a private alcove near the East Room. My breasts were already full, the dull ache that marked the hours between feedings. A few more minutes, then I&#39;d withdraw to the Residence.</p>
<p>I pressed my hand against the cool wall, steadying myself. Through the archway, I could see them both-my father, holding court near the press pool, teaching the next generation his legendary strategies. And Casey, working the German contingent, building alliances that would shape policy for years to come.</p>
<p>Both of them playing the game we&#39;d all devoted our lives to. Both of them brilliant at it.</p>
<p>Both of them alone.</p>
<p>I played it too. The literacy initiative my father had just praised-that was mine. The education framework currently moving through Congress-I&#39;d written half of it during late-night strategy sessions with Michael. The childcare funding that would actually pass because I&#39;d personally lobbied three key senators. Real policy work that changed real lives.</p>
<p>I had what I&#39;d always wanted. Political influence at the highest level. My father&#39;s respect, even if he didn&#39;t know he was giving it to me. Work that mattered.</p>
<p>I&#39;d just paid for it with everything I&#39;d been.</p>
<p>A discreet cough behind me. Elena&#39;s nanny, right on schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Rivera, whenever you&#39;re ready.&quot;</p>
<p>I straightened, smoothing my gown. &quot;Thank you. I&#39;m ready.&quot;</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs to the residence and entered the nursery where Elena was already fussing in her bassinet.</p>
<p>She stopped crying when she saw me. Reached for me with absolute certainty.</p>
<p>I lifted her into my arms, pushing the gown&#39;s draped shoulder down in one practiced motion. She latched immediately, one small hand pressed against my breast.</p>

<p>Below, the state dinner continued. In twenty minutes I&#39;d return to it-diplomatic conversations, strategic positioning, the careful performance of First Lady duties. Real influence. Real power wielded from within the costume I could never take off.</p>
<p>My father would never know I&#39;d finally become what he&#39;d wanted. Casey would never hold the daughter she&#39;d created. And I would never be Evan again.</p>
<p>But the work would continue. The policies would pass. And Elena would grow up loved.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d imagined when I first put on those pink panties to prove a point to Governor Beauregard Fenstemaker III.</p>
<p>But it was enough.</p>
<p>It had to be.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p><strong>Author&#39;s Note</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for going with me on Evan&#39;s dark journey.</p>
<p>When I set out to write this story, I knew I wanted to blend transgender fiction themes with political thriller-taking the cynical power dynamics of Robert Penn Warren&#39;s All the King&#39;s Men, the intimate political character work of Billy Lee Brammer&#39;s The Gay Place, and the psychological manipulation of Gillian Flynn&#39;s Gone Girl. The question that drove me was: what if someone&#39;s greatest character flaw wasn&#39;t a moral failing, but the desperate need to matter? And what if someone brilliant enough saw that flaw and knew exactly how to exploit it?</p>
<p>This is my second novel, and writing it has been both challenging and rewarding. The serial publication format meant I got to see your reactions in real-time, which helped me understand which emotional beats were landing and where the story needed adjustment. Your feedback shaped this work in ways I couldn&#39;t have anticipated.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who engaged thoughtfully with the darker themes here-the manipulation, the loss of identity, the trap of achieving exactly what you thought you wanted. These aren&#39;t comfortable topics, and I realize that many readers wanted justice to be served. But politics rarely traffics in comeuppance, and fiction in the tradition of Warren and Flynn shows us how power actually works, how manipulation succeeds, how the Willie Starks and Amy Dunnes of the world often win completely.</p>
<p>As I did after finishing Highway to Elle, I need to decompress for a little bit and write some shorter works. But I&#39;m already deep into planning my next longer project, which will explore different transformation mechanisms while maintaining the psychological complexity and moral ambiguity that I hope you&#39;ve come to expect from my work.</p>
